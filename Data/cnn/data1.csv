0,"Phillip & Keith  Attached is the first draw request, I will need some of these funds immediately.
I think checks out of Bishops Corner, L.P. may be the easiest, or you can wire money to me and I can write the checks when needed.
Please let me know how you wish to handle this and I will proceed.
Additionally, it is getting close to closing.
I will need to get contracts signed at this point as soon as possible.
We can handle this in two ways.
I prefer that you elect me as a Vice - President of the General Partner and then I will sign all documents, or I can Federal Express contracts (this is more difficult).
I have a funeral at 10:00 and I will be back about 1:00.
I look forward to hearing from you.

You will then be directed to a screen that asks for information such as: Name Address City, State Zip+4 Phone # E-Mail Address  After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be instructed to change your password to anything that you desire.
Always remember that your password is case sensitive.
One major change is the wording of your accounts names (they have changed to product types and not descriptions).
You can change your account descriptions by clicking on the Nicknames button and entering your own account description.
We are still working on getting the information to post again correctly (your old account information has been removed, and we hope to have this information converted shortly and back on-line), so you will notice that credits and debits do not show up in the appropriate columns.
Transaction descriptions are correct and the balances information is correct as of our last day of processing (11/16/01).
We appreciate your patience and continued support.

1,"To our IBS Customers that are still hanging in there:  We understand your continued frustration and express our sincerest apologies for our inability to give complete and accurate answers to your questions.
The problems that we are seeing are one of three (3) possibilities:  1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was the correct password) and been given the error message that you have exceeded your opportunities for today, and you receive the message ""You have failed to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset.""
This is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you online (on the phone).
Should you receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @ 830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182.
If you reach our voice mail (or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back #.
2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder).
Please try again using the last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the primary account holder.
3)  If you see this error message ""Invalid login; please try again"" (after three [3] or more tries), then you possibly fall into this last category.
Your account is one of the few that did not convert correctly (we will not release any information about these accounts until we verify that all information is correct and accurate).
We are finalizing these accounts today and should have them available for access this afternoon (late) or this evening.
Once we release these accounts for IBS access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will be directed to a screen that asks for information such as:  Name Address City, State Zip+4 Phone # E-Mail Address  After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can at this point change your password back to what it was before).
Always remember that your password is case sensitive.
Should you get into IBS (before early evening [6:00pm]), the balance and transactional information displayed is as of 11/16/01 (Friday night).
We will have this information updated by 6:00pm (hopefully), and then information will be as of Monday (11/19/01).
Again we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying) ordeal, and we look forward to continuing to service your IBS needs in the future.
Sincerely,

0,"To all of our esteemed & prized Internet Banking  (IBS) Clients:  You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls (or e-mails).
We really do but have been holed up trying to complete this project ASAP.
We knew that this might upset some clients, but we found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our users back on-line.
We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #).
This process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100 IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected.
After verifying data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track.
Some of you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want displayed on your IBS screen.
Should this be the case, please e-mail (or phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right away.
To our IBS Billpayer clients:  During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring payments scheduled to process on particular days).
This has become our highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this information.
We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the months of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence (and support).
Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and ourselves) do not have to go through this process again.
Should you be one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account information, please refer to the following information:

"
0,"Liane,   As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to  manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.
A single buyer entered the  marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices  ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.
At the  time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15  cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to  report into the index calculation.
Additionally, these trades are out of  line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.
We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from  September 25 to September 27.
These are the complete list of trades from  Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage  firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).
Please see the attached spreadsheet for a  trade by trade list and a summary.
We have also included a summary of gas  daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread  relationships.
The two key points from this data are as follows:   1.
The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater  than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.
2.
The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &  Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and         October gas daily.
It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that  are dramatically different.
I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.
Hopefully, the  trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to  determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are  outliers.
I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in  establishing a reasonable index.
It is Enron's belief that the trades at  $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the  calculation of index.
It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to  conduct our physical and financial business.
Please contact me  anytime I can assist you towards this goal.
Sincerely,
"

0,"Gentlemen  I wanted to provide you an update on the status of the Refco private label platform deal.
We have had several meetings since I first presented the idea to you all.
Unfortunately, Refco's headquarters was in One World Financial Center which was severely damaged by debris from the World Trade Center collapse.
They suffered no human losses from the disaster, but their offices are off limits and all their computers and paper files are inaccessible for the time being.
They are up and running out of a Jersey City location with some back up capability.
To briefly summarize the discussion so far, ENW would build a Refco branded platform similar to EOL that would be accessed by Refco's customers.
Enron would provide transactable prices to the site with wider spreads and potentially smaller minimum volumes.
Refco customers would transact on the site with Refco as their counterparty and Refco would sleeve the transactions to Enron allowing us to consolidate our credit risk to a singular credit, Refco.
The products contemplated include various Nymex look-a-like products and other liquid swaps in oil, natural gas, and electricity.
Revenue would come to Enron in the form of license fees for the platform, transaction fees, and origination from the additional volume create by the wider margin products.
Revenue would come to Refco in the form of transaction fees.
Refco has a similar arrangement in place for FX with Dresner bank and have announced a similar platform for bonds and securities with Cantor Fitzgerald/E-speed.
All that being said, they are anxious to move the discussion forward and we have planned a visit for them to come to Houston in 2 weeks.
Attending will be Gary Weiss, SVP Refco Group Ltd. LLC and President & CEO of Refco F/X Ltd LLC, and Joe Murphy, CEO Refco Futures Ltd. LLC.
The purpose of this visit is for them to give us a presentation on the Refco Group of companies, discuss the products and estimations of revenue streams based on their current futures business, and discuss the possible structure of the deal.
The meeting is scheduled to begin at 2:30pm Thursday Oct 4 and expected to last the balance of the day and possibly into the next morning.
I will approach you all individually to get your feedback on how you would like to interact with them and when.
I realize there are significant issues to be addressed.
Refco currently has some 175,000 collateralized customer accounts ranging from Institutional Investors & locals down to individuals.
We have put these into 2 buckets which have different profiles.
Phase 1 would include the Top 2000 accounts which are largely substantial institutional investors, locals, and high net worth individuals.
If this proves successful, phase 2 would be rolled out with products designed to attract activity from the smaller investors.
The idea would be to automate the products as much as is practical.
Mark Tayor in Legal has already spoken with their counsel and is comfortable that they have reviewed all the legal angles thoroughly.
Refco advises that if the have accounts back up by collateral guaranteed by them, they become Eligible Contract Participants (ECPs) able to execute derivatives.
So, they believe that the majority of the 175,000 accounts they have could be ECPs for the purposes of this deal.
Credit is reviewing the Refco financials and we plan to discuss this thoroughly during their visit.
Please do not hesitate to contact me at x36413 if you have any questions or comments and I will be getting in touch with you early next week to get your feedback.
Regards

0,"The World Wide RibFest ""celebration of the Rib"" is coming up.
This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time).
I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne.
For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).
A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a ""peoples choice"" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).
Every year, my wife asks the following: 	""So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?""
I reply:	""Nothing comes to mind.""
She replies:	""No.""
As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.
So, appetizers, sides, desserts and food & drink for the kids are also served.
The competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place.
The appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.
There are a couple of changes to this year's competition: The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bellaire Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing ""personal reasons""  Date & Time Saturday November 3rd.
We fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging takes place between 3:00 and 3:30.
Where 4807 Elm Street in Bellaire  Directions (from John Mee himself) From downtown, take 59s to 610s.
The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit.
Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April.
Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building.
Right before that building is Elm Street.
Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street.
Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don't have a clue...
KIDS Bring 'em!
We'll have the Moonwalk set up for them again this year, and we'll have hot dogs, burgers, popcorn and drinks for them.

0,"Hey John!
How are you??
I've been following the Enron story closely, which means I've thought of you a lot recently.
I hope things are going well, despite the uncertainty.
I ran into someone from our Enron days today, which made me think of a funny story.
Do you remember when John Mee tried to eat 8 Big Macs and hurled instead?
John was talking to my boss, Chuck Clough, today, who he's known since childhood and is a mentor of sorts.
When he got off the phone, Chuck told me who he was talking to and the name John Mee struck me as familiar.
I asked Chuck if he was a big kid who'd gone to Harvard and he said yes.
So I tell him the Big Mac story and Chuck picks up the phone and calls John to ask him if that was him because if so, I knew him.
Poor thing says ""yeah, that was me, but not one of my finer moments...""  I could tell he was embarrassed.
I guess there are some things in life you just never live down.
I also ran into some friends of yours in Bermuda last month.
We shared a cab to the airport and realized we had all been at Enron, though not at the same time.
I mentioned that I really loved the company, especially how young it was and that I had a friend who joined right out of undergrad and is now doing really well.
They immediately said ""John Arnold!""
Shocked the hell out of me, honestly.
They were very funny in saying that I had made a ""bad trade"" by marrying my husband instead of you.
I told them I would keep that in mind....  ;-}  I would tell you their names, but I can't remember off the top of my head.
They both work for a weather trading firm in the Northeast now, with Lynda Clemmons.
Well, gotta run to the gym - been putting it off as long as I could today.
I really do hope you're doing well.
Please drop me a line when you aren't trading up a storm...

1,"John and Dutch -  This email is sent to discuss what is needed with respect to NYMEX quotes from the broker market.
Simply put, we need quotes on every forward term for which we currently have positions.
It seems that the best way to obtain relevant information would be to ask for the following:  1.
Annual quotes (a quote for 2003, a quote for 2004, etc.)
2.
Seasonal quotes (winter '03, summer '04, etc.)
In short, try to obtain pricing to match any positions which we currently have in the books.
I know that this will be difficult to accomplish, but please do what you can.
We need these quotes for every day starting with Nov 28 through today.
We will continue to need daily updates for the immediate future.
Also, I am aware that our current position doesn't give us much stroke to ask for a lot of pricing data.
However, this information is critical as it will be needed for calculation of termination values.
Please do whatever you can to obtain as much data as possible.
Additionally, we need to get quotes from as many different brokers as possible to help verify pricing.
Please let me know if the brokers are not accomodating your requests; we may need to ask John or Louise to place calls into the brokers to move this process along.
If you have any questions or comments, you can normally find me in the ""war room"" next to Louise's office.
If I'm not there, please call me at (713) 927-3003 or at ext 53923.

0,"I am changing the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 2004 to better  replicate seasonal fundamentals.
There are convincing arguments as to why  the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time.
However, in the previous  methodology they blew out.
For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232  while Cal 10 was .256.
I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the  summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months  of July and August over time.
The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for  the month as well as for the year.
These premiums are as follows:  Jan  -.008 Feb -.004 Mar -.001 Apr .002 May .003 Jun .004 Jul .004 Aug .004 Sep .003 Oct .002 Nov -.003 Dec -.006   These premiums start in Jan 2004 On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959,  the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the  4/5 spread was marked at .0475.
In the old methodology Jan 2003  = 2.959 Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.9965 Jan 2005  =          2.9965 + .0475 = 3.044   In the new methodology Jan 2003  = 2.959 Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 - .008 =2.9885 Jan 2005  = 2.9885 + .0475 -.008 = 3.028  The only change in the formula is from: Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table to Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month  premium table  The seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when I  change them

0,"Hi All:  Just got off the phone with the folks @ Dominion regarding some indicative pricing I gave them last week for (i) a 7000 Heat Rate Call in TVA; and, (ii) a 7000 Heat Rate Call in SERC.
FYI, I had quoted the TVA Call  @ $3.97/KW-mo ($1 over our mid) for a 4yr call beginning 1/1/03 with $2 VOM and 5x16 avail with 16hr mins.
I also quoted the SERC 7000 call at $1 over our mid, at $3.98/KW-mo for 1 yr and $4.12/KW-mo for 4 yrs, again with 5x16 and 16 hour mins.
The good news is --- this pricing generated some interest.
"

Capacity:	2003 - 100MW 				2004 - 250MW 				2005 - 570MW for five years  	Will accept day-ahead dispatch.
Really want 8 hour minimum runs w/ 5x16 availability.
Heat Rate:	7200 		VOM		$2/MWh  2.
Entergy -   		They want a straight 7x24, 365-day power purchase @ fixed price.
Capacity:	65MW 		Start Date:	July 2002 		Term:		5 Years 		Price:		$x/MWh  3.
TVA - Peaker  		Really want intra-day call w/4hr notice for 4hr minimum run time.
Capacity:	Tell me what, if any, we can do.
Start Date:	June 2004 		Availability:	5x16 June-Aug; Dec-Mar 		Heat Rate:	10,900 		VOM:		$2/MWh  		Let's really try to see if we can do the intra-day.
If absolutely not available for 4hr 		min run time, see if we can do 8hr min.
If this is absolutely not possible, let's try 		to quote day-ahead 8hr min at the very least.
4.
TVA - Combined Cycle  		This one we already quoted at $3.97/KW-mo for 4-year, 5x16 call, beginning 		1/1/03 for 7,000 Heat Rate; $2 VOM.
This was for day-ahead, 16hr min run time.
Tell me how much the price changes if we reduce min run time from 16hrs to 		8hrs.
Please call me in NY @ 212-715-5953 to discuss, if you have any questions.
Thanks for all your work.
I think we have a real opportunity here, if we can respond positively on a few fronts.
Regards, Greg

0,"Harry, Iris and Brandon:  I asked ConEd if they were prepared to hear our OFFER to buy peaking capacity from the Lakewood expansion.
They are ""in the midst of preparing a draft term sheet for purchasing the output/tolling"" so we'll have to wait to see the parameters of sale.
I also asked if they would like to see PJM WEST synthetic toll offer from us.
Unfortunately, NO.
To the extent it matters, the on-line date is now set for late 2002, so they would like to see our offer for a Jan '03 start date.
Given that these guys are doing a real comparison against bricks and mortar, we would be looking at a $63 million option premium for 500MW @ 3.50/KW-mo over a three-year term; $84 million for a four-year term, I would hope we could be able to find a way to hedge the risk of too many $500 hours killing us.
Is there any cap we could buy to protect our downside risk here and still make this deal attractive?
The heat rate call is struck at 10,900!
"
0,"Harry and Brandon:   Just to memorialize what I just communicated to Harry over the phone.
My interface at TVA emailed yesterday requesting a phone dialogue to discuss where our Synthetic Peaker offer needs to be for TVA to execute.
Holding all assumptions constant, we would need to come in between $2.25-$2.30/KW-month in order for TVA to execute.
Our indicative quote was $3.90/KW-month.
I will attempt to find out if they have other offers in the sub-$2.50 range or if they are just setting their own bid at the requested price.

Rationale: The TYZ/TYH roll will be impacted by a number of factors.
Most important, we believe, will be changes in the contract's cheapest-to-deliver caused by market movements.
Changes in CTD will change the amount of net positive carry that is the primary determinant of the TYZ/TYH roll's value.
For example, The TYZ/TYH roll priced using the 6.5% 2/10 has 35.75/32 of net carry, while the roll priced with the 4.7% 11/08 has only 28.5/32 of net carry.

Love you-L            A bum, who obviously has seen more than his share of hard times, approaches a well dressed gentleman on the street.
""Hey, Buddy, can you spare two dollars?""
The well-dressed gentleman responds, ""You are not going to spend in on liquor are you?""
""No, sir, I don't drink,"" retorts the bum.
""You are not going to throw it away in some crap game, are  you?""
asks the gentleman.
""No way, I don't gamble,"" answers the bum.
""You wouldn't waste the money at a golf course for greens fees, would you?""
asks the man.
""Never,"" says the bum, ""I don't play golf.""
The man asks the bum if he would like to come home with him for a home cooked meal.
The bum accepts eagerly.
While they are heading for the man's house, the bum's curiosity gets the better of him.
""Isn't your wife going to be angry when she sees a guy like me at your table?""
""Probably,"" says the man, ""but it will be worth it.
I want  her to see what happens to a guy who doesn't drink, gamble  or play golf.""

Let me know if anyone has a problem with the draft date, i.e.
can't make it,  too early, too late.
If not, THE MEXIMULLETS look forward to a return to Prominence this year.

1,"Celeste,  I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the  program affect my eligibility for promotion.
At the end of last year you  informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid  year review (my 2 year anniversary).
It was my impression that the only  reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was  tenure.
Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible  for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.
I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this  PRC?
Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

1,"Tom has come to a decision on what to do with the ubiquitous accrual value.
60% of this value should be credited to Greg's Transport expense on a monthly  basis.
Tom, in turn, will cover Ed on this portion of the expense.
For example:  Accrual Value comes out to be $300,000 for the month of April.
This means that:  Greg's portion of this value is 60% of $300,000 = $180,000 Tom's portion of this value is 40% of $300,000 = $120,000  Greg's Transport Expense is ($700,000) So, Tom will cover                      $180,000 of this expense Greg's adjusted Expense is   ($520,000)  Greg's P&L is net better off by the $180,000 of accrual value Tom's P&L is net better off by $120,000  of accrual value which had not been  previously recognized.
Ed's P&L is net unchanged from all of the above.

1,"Fellas:   Enjoyed the weekend with you all immensely.
I  think Travis and Don Jr. are my new benchmarks for late night longevity, and  Don.
Sr. is my new benchmark for marksmanship from a seated position.
I want to make you all aware of a new organization  that I have helped start up.
The Saltwater Conservation Association of  Texas was founded to give Texans a new conservation resource that is dedicated  solely to the coast of Texas.
We are a 501 (c) 3, non-profit, and we have no paid  staff.
Our goal for the next 3-5 years is to assist TPWD in their effort  to retire as many commercial shrimping licenses as possible, as Texas shrimpers  now accumulate around 80 million pounds of bycatch annually.
This bycatch  includes an incredible amount of flounder and croaker, not to mention numerous  forage fish for trout and reds.
We are an authorized agent of TPWD, whereby we can  solicit bids from shrimpers, purchase their license, and then hand it over to  TPWD.
The program is intended to target bay shrimping (not bait shrimping)  as the bay shrimpers drag their nets for hours on end, whereas the bait  shrimpers usually only drag for around 20 minutes or so.
To make a long  story short, the effect of thousands of chains dragging across the bays on a  daily basis is not good for the ecosystem.
I hope you will all consider becoming a Founding  Father.
If not, then any level of sponsorship is certainly  appreciated.
Details of our organization and sponsorship levels can be  found at our website - www.scatexas.org  -  or you can call direct at 512-392-1256.
You can join online or print an  application and mail it in.
Thanks for your consideration, and once again I  really enjoyed the weekend with you all.
Take care.
Sincerely,
"

0,"All,  The Enpower Database is in need of some routine maintenance and clean-up.
The work is designed to improve performance and expandability for the future.
We were hoping to utilize the Thanksgiving holiday to perform some of this work.
What we need from you guys is permission to have some agreed upon downtime for Enpower over the holidays so we can run some clean-up jobs on the database.
However, we do need to execute the jobs in such a way as to have a minimal impact on the Real Time trading desks.
Here is our plan as was previously discussed with David Poston:  Wed Nov 21, 8pm - 10pm Central (6pm - 8pm Portland), for unrelated hardware maintenance  Beginning Saturday thru Sunday, rolling 3 hour outages: (NOTE:  during the below times, the system may not actually be totally down, but error messages may occur so don't be alarmed)  Starting Saturday morning at 10am (8am Portland Time) we will be contacting the East & West Real Time Desks to determine if they can afford a 3 hour down-time window.
When the clean-up job is completed, we will contact the related desks that the Enpower application is now available.
We will then want to keep the environment stable for at least an hour to allow the traders to catch up from the down-time.
We will repeat this process during the following time periods.
Saturday, November 24nd from 10am (8am Portland) - Saturday, November 24th @ 6pm (4pm Portland) Saturday, November 24nd from 8pm (6pm Portland) - Sunday, November 25th @ 8am (6am Portland) Sunday, November 25th from 10am (8am Portland) - Sunday, November 25th @ 6pm (4pm Portland)

1,"The last I heard, the MISO is supposed to begin offering service on their OASIS tomorrow for service starting January 1.
I wanted to let all of you know a bit about where we stand with regards to that process.
I have been working with several different folks here and at the MISO to ensure that we are ready to do business with the MISO and request service.
The MISO OASIS seems to be accepting our Tradewave Certs, so we just need to get our MISO login for their systems.
Today, the MISO will be sending out logins to their systems via FedEx, and should arrive prior to 10am.
Christi Nicolay will be receiving this information and distributing it as soon as it arrives.
Unfortunately, the MISO has been (as you probably know) cutting things closer and closer to the edge.
This login was supposed to be delivered a couple weeks ago, but they have just gotten around to sending it out.
Hopefully, we will not have any problems with it once it arrives.
As I understand it, there should be only one login set up for ""EPMI 24-Hour Operations,"" with a login of ""Enron.""
The password is currently only known by the MISO, but should be contained in the letter we receive tomorrow.
This login is a temporary one until we complete our final registration.
This final registration has been a bit more of a pain, as it has involved contractual agreements and credit obligations.
I am still working with our Legal, Credit, and AP folks to get everything set up.
Again, the MISO sent the final documents out fairly recently, and we have not had a great amount of time to review, analyze, and negotiate their terms.
Hopefully, we will have come to agreement with MISO about those items, and be able to file that final application soon.
If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach me at my desk (X53771) or via my cellular (713-927-4680).
Obviously, you can also call Christi (X37007) or Susan Lindberg (X30596) as well.

0,"Transmission Customers:  Since FERC did not act on our September 11, 2001, PJM West compliance filing (Docket No.
RT01-98-000) at its December 19th meeting, Allegheny Power (AP) will need to delay the start of the PJM West arrangement until March 1, 2002.
In order to accommodate the further delay in the start date, AP will need to sell transmission service under the AP OATT and on the AP OASIS for the month of February 2002.
To accomplish this, AP will do the following:  *	AP will attempt to call the Transmission Customers that have ""confirmed"" point-to-point transmission service reservations on the PJM OASIS for the paths that are not currently valid for PJM (AEP and DLCO) by 4:30 p.m. on December 21 to determine if they need comparable service on the AP system.
If that is the case, AP will honor the ""confirmed"" reservations and the PJM OASIS timestamps.
*	Yearly service that was not given the option to exercise roll-over rights on the PJM paths (AP to PJM and PJM to AP) will be given the option to extend that service through the month of February.
AP will attempt to call these Transmission Customers by 4:30 p.m. on December 21.
*	ATCs for the month of February will be uploaded to the AP OASIS starting at 8 a.m. on December 24.
The upload will include all valid AP paths (AEP, PJM, VAP, FE and DLCO).
*	Transmission Marketing will post a message on the OASIS when the ATC upload is started and when it is complete.
*	Transmission service beyond March 1, 2002, will continue to be sold by PJM per the Interim Coordination Agreement that was filed with FERC on February 12, 2001.
*	January 30, 2002, is the last scheduled FERC meeting in January.
If FERC does not act on our filing at that time, the start of the PJM West arrangement may then be delayed until April 1, 2002.
Further information will be provided at that time, if necessary.

That payment was made on behalf of the Enron estate to ensure critical operations  are completed and  key people are retained; 	b) we are working to provide, as per our discussion this am, a new retention package for estate (and NewCo) employees for the next 90 days that should be forthcoming in the next several weeks; 	c) you are not in breach of your employement agreement by working towards NewCo versus Netco or the overall estate regardless of which company wrote or sponsored your original contract (ie) ENA , EES, EGM, etc.
These are all Enron assets; and 	d) I envision that NewCo upon it formation will have its own compensation plan which will provide competitive base salaries, a bonus program consistent or better than Enron's or possibly similar to what is being discussed about Netco, an equity participation plan, employment agreements and a competitive benefits package.
By copy to Jeff McMahon, I wanted everyone to know this is consistent with the overall message that I have been receiving.

In order to be able to set up books in RisktRAC, the only role that currently exists is the Risk Controls group, who has access to all books, hierarchies etc (all groups, all commodities).
With NetCo coming on line, the Risk Controls group has been asked to approve RisktRAC access to the new NetCo controls group so they can set up the new gas books that have been requested.
I am uncomfortable granting access to NetCo personnel, as they would be able to see all the estate info, including Europe, EIM, EGM, ENA etc.
Also, it is my understanding that the IT groups are working on splitting out the systems but will not be able to do so until after these books have to be set up (deadline for them is next Monday).
As such, I recommend the following:   In order to ensure there is a segration between NetCo and the estate, until the systems are segregated, the IT groups should be responsible for setting up books, curves etc.

0,"Want to clarify if the Estate has the right to do a services deal with a 3r= d party with our copy of the licenses after the NetCo deal is done.
=20 =20 Here is the issue (as per an old draft of the Assignment and License Agreem= ent).
=20 In the current deal, Enron assigns, sells, transfers and conveys to NetCo a= ll of the rights, title and interest in and to the software and intellectua= l property rights.
In other words, NetCo will be the owner of the Enron de= veloped applications or software including EOL, TAGG, ERMS, DCAF, Sitara, U= nify, EnPower, etc.
Enron or the estate gets back a worldwide, perpetual, = irrevocable, nonexclusive, fully paid-up, royalty free license of all of th= em for any purpose.
I am not sure why the original deal was done this way = as opposed to Enron continuing to own all the software and just granting a = perpetual, royalty free license to all the applications to NetCo, but I rea= lize we are in the 11th hour.
=20 What it also says is that Enron shall not have the right to grant any subli= cense to any third party for use within the field of ""wholesale trading of = natural gas and electricity within North America.""
It also says that NetCo=  can't, as long as Enron owns 20% of NetCo, assign or license the software = to any third party or use the software for any of the prohibited commoditie= s. =20 Is trading the act of buying and selling of the commodities?
Once a NetCo = deal is completed, we want to have NetCo and the estate agree that trading = is buying and selling, not service or fulfillment.
I would like the Estate=  to maintain the right and ability to sub-license all the applications asso= ciated with logistics and settlement (not EOL or those systems associated w= ith buying and selling and order capture) to a third party that would have = the opportunity to build a mid and back office processing and service busin= ess around those sub-licenses in all commodities, including gas and power i= n North America.
The Estate may even outsource to this 3rd party and take = back a service agreement from this 3rd party as well as some of the future = profit it generates from this service company.
This would allow the estate=  to get value for the applications and associated employees on a service de= al.
NetCo should not be concerned about fulfillment as being defined as co= mpetition.
Also, the estate is keeping CommodityLogic and it is much more = valuable as a tool within a complete services entity.
=20 I have not heard whether the final purchase and sale agreement has a non-co= mpete or not.
If there is not one, then doing the above should be no issue.
=20 Need an answer quick on if we need to change anything or if you think that = we have this right as written or if you think NetCo has an issue.
=20 Also, I assume that we can use our licenses within the estate and its affil= iates and subs any way we want in all commodities.

He travels from Portland where he is based, to Houston, as needed, to work on Power settlements and volume management for EES, and these expenses are for airfare, hotel and meals for the week prior to the Christmas holiday.

Please have a member of your team expedite the review of this expense report, so that it can be released today, if possible.
I assume that they will confirm to us that the report has been released so that Murray will no longer be behind in his expense reimbursements, since he will be traveling to Houston again (and therefore incurring expenses) on Monday.

1,"Greg,  Just as a follow up to our conversation, I have serious concerns about the estate's ability to service IT requests.
The number of people that remain in the estate, that understand the gas and power systems, is limited (and we're receiving resignations now).
With this in mind, I would like to have the ability to outsource the IT department (applications, infrastructure) and potentially the back office staff to a consulting company (potentially Accenture or CGEY).
We would need to move the estate employees into this company and incentivize them to stay.
The consulting company could then supplement the staff and the Enron estate employees could now have a career path at the consulting company.
To make this deal attractive, the consulting company would like to have the ability to create a services company and offer IT and fulfillment and processing services to other companies.
By the way, this could be done for other commodities outside gas and power.
The deal would have to include royalty payments to the estate for each additional services agreement.
The intent is to make the services company into a thriving business.
We would also want to sell Commodity Logic (IP included) to round out the services offering.
We could consider selling the IP to our EGM and EIM systems as well.
All in all, the intent is to bring value to the estate and support the estate while the businesses wind down or start up.
We must make sure that the NETCO agreement allows the estate to license the gas and power software in some capacity and continue to develop the applications.
As an aside, the estate cannot perform on the Bridgeline or AEP deals.
There are not enough resources that fully understand the system, therefore, we cannot maintain a fully operational production quality system.
These deals must either be moved to NETCO or we need to find another alternative (the above referenced services company or selling the software to AEP and Bridgeline).
I know this is long winded, but I needed to get these points down on paper.
I am on vacation next week, but can be reached on my cell phone at 713-240-0919 or at my house in Kiawah at 843-768-6651.

There are several important points to keep in mind with this forecast: 1.
This is our best guess at this point.
As other business units clarify their business plans, it will affect our activity.
Once their plans are set and communicated to us, we can better forecast our numbers.
2.
This forecast represents the estate only.
(Since that is what we discussed in the meeting on Monday)  We have made no attempt to forecast NETCo since that has already been done and is seperate.
3.Infrastructures numbers are somewhat soft due to the Outlook problems experienced yesterday.

1,"Andrew, etal    I wanted to provide an update on what people should expect on monday in respect to payment proposals.
We initiated test files on Thursday & Friday, to validate the distribution list and allow the BU Approvers & Delegates to get a feel for the data  We experienced some email address issues that have been corrected.
There are some additional names that were provided late Friday that will be added on Monday.
If your name was added by Andrew on Friday, you will not receive the files until Tuesday.
Expect data by Company type.
Non-dip companies - Reports will include all unpaid open items that have not been blocked for payment.
You should be marking the items that you DO NOT WANT to pay in the file & forwarding it to George Wasaff.
We will only release the items authorized by the BU & the cash committee.
Dip Companies - We will not be running a proposal for the DIP companies on Monday.
We are still working with the BU's to ensure that they have properly blocked the pre-petition open items posted to the commodity vendors before sending the proposals for approval.
We expect to finalize this on Monday so we can start the process on Tuesday.
It is imperative that this activity be completed before initiating this daily process.
When we run these on Tuesday, I would not really expect that many items.
We have not begun to process the post-petiton non-trade invoices.
We have been working to establish a process for segregating these invoices as well and have blocked posting of December activity until everyone was ready.
We expect to open up December on Monday.
I feel very confident that we will be ready to initiate this process for the Dip Companies on Tuesday.
If you have any questions or concerns, please give me a call at 5-5301 or drop me email.

1,"Sally, One of the things that Greg Piper has asked me to do is to take a look at the rest of the year and get each of the VP's to assess their margins and EBIT for the remainder of 2001.
For Energy Operations, that is usually very easy since there has been no revenues, and all of the costs are allocated out, so there should be zero EBIT if nothing changed.
Given your present direction, however, you may be generating some margin in 2001.
Do you have a feel for an amount I can put into our analysis and will 100% of your costs continue to be billed out or will some be applied to this new activity?
I am hoping to put something together next week, so if you or a designate could let me know in a few days I would appreciate it.

0,"In order to maximize the potential synergies between the various mid- and back- office functions, to decrease replication errors, and to increase communication standards; are there any plans of creating a platform or reference center to bridge the differences between the systems, processes, and terminology of the various departments.
Perhaps a common resource center offering access to on-line system manuals and business unit overviews (which currently exist only in paper form or in some cases within the actual system database).
The reason: With Enron's size and transaction volume, many of the functions and the data managed by various groups within Enron (i.e.
credit, risk, settlements, volume management, global contracts, global counterparties, global rates, and the commercial systems) are fragmented.
Having participated in various process reviews and trouble-shooting/clean-up projects there seems to be a large disconnect between groups operating in various systems.
These disconnects; rather they be lack of information or understanding of how data flows between systems, how the data managed within each system impacts other upstream or downstream systems, or how the business processes within one group/system impacts the overall functionality of other groups, create large cracks producing an opportunity for mismanaged data, incomplete business reports, and increased risk to Enron.
The ideal objective; increase communication standards through a better understanding of system data functions/requirements and business processes, decrease system downtime and replication errors through a better understanding of the data relationships between systems, maximize department-to-department synergies (left hand knows what the right hand is doing), eliminate repetition, and further reduce potential risks to Enron due to information/business process oversight.

0,"The following is an update of the last two meetings of the FASB and decisions made regarding goodwill and intangible assets:  The Board reiterated that they intend to release the statement in final form in June 2001 despite publicity to the contrary.
The Board decided that goodwill should be tested for impairment annually rather than on an events-and-circumstances basis as previously proposed.
Additionally, goodwill should be tested for impairment during interim periods if an event or circumstance occurs between annual tests that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its book value.
It should also be tested for impairment on an interim basis when (1) a more-likely-than-not expectation exists that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of, or (2) a significant asset group within a reporting unit is tested for recoverability under SFAS 121.
The Board changed the proposed method for determining the amount of goodwill to be included in the net assets to be disposed of.
Under the new method, a portion of the reporting unit's goodwill will be allocated to all divestitures.
I do not believe that the Board gave full consideration to all of the issues surrounding this decision.
In particular, they did not address application to divestitures that result in a loss prior to or as a result of goodwill allocation and disposals of equity, cost or fair value method investments.
additionally, the calculation itself is arbitrary and onerous in that fair values of the reporting unit and its recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities will have to be determined each time a divestiture is done.
I will be consulting with AA on this to see if they can encourage the Board to give thought to these issues prior to releasing the final statement since they do not intend to discuss the issue further at this time.
The Board changed the proposed method of allocating goodwill upon an acquisition to allow for allocation of goodwill in an acquisition to a reporting unit even if none of the assets or liabilities of the acquired company have been allocated to that reporting unit.
Please feel free to call me if you have any questions on the latest developments.
Thanks.

0,"The Board decided in today's meeting to delay the effective date for adoption of the goodwill and intangible asset portion of the business combinations exposure draft to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, permitting early adoption for fiscal years beginning after March 31, 2001 if financial statements for the first quarter have not yet been reported.
This means that goodwill amortization will continue through year-end.
Discussion is continuing on when the first impairment analysis will be required given the new adoption date and whether or not initial impairments may be reported as a change in accounting principle.
Adoption of the business combinations portion of the exposure draft is still anticipated to be required for acquisitions subsequent to June 30, 2001.
The main implication of this is that more excess purchase price is expected to be allocated to identifiable intangible assets rather than goodwill for acquisitions completed after this date.
The pooling-of-interests method of accounting for business combinations is still anticipated to be eliminated as of June 30, 2001.
"
0,"There seems to be some confusion around which DPR captures credit reserve and consumption premium reserves and which balance sheet these items fall on.
My understanding in talking with both Don and Kevin is that since EES is, on a go-forward basis, being granted origination (which would be the residual after all reserves are applied) that all prudency/reserve items will rest on the WhEES DPR.
The EES DPR will be just a single line net origination number.
We do need to capture the activity related to DSM in the EES DPR (including some portion of credit reserve and drift) but until we have the system capability to capture this it may just have to be part of the whole WhEES bucket.
This tracks with the idea that all future exposures (be they be wholesale price movement, tariff movement, credit exposure, etc.)
be borne by EWS.
If so, they need the reserves to properly offset any realized activity.
The balance sheet reserves associated with these items already rest in the ledgers that are rolling up underneath EWS now.
Reflecting the positions on the WhEES DPR will make them consistent with how we are capturing them from an accounting perspective.
If anyone disagrees with this treatment, please respond to all the parties above so we can resolve this issue.
If there are no objections I would recommend moving the credit reserve over at the next possible point.
Wade  P.S.
This thinking only reflects how things are currently contemplated, if the mix around what is with EWS vs. EES (i.e., accounts receivable) we may want to rethink the credit reserve portion.

0,"I am due to get the revised Risk Management reorganization groupings this afternoon.
At that point, additional cost centers may need to be set up so it will probably be the first of next week before any transfers could begin to happen.
Given that it will be the third week of May at that point, the effective date will probably have to be June 1, 2001 for SAP cost center reporting (correct)?
In any event, to enable us to have as clean a cut-off as possible for financial reporting purposes, I would like to wait and make these moves effective July 1, 2001.
That way their existing cost centers are pure for a full quarter and the new cost centers start off clean in a new quarter.
This will also help us from a planning perspective in developing a clean go-forward budget for these groups.
This will have no impact on our financial reporting, we will simply allocate costs to EWS from EES, rather than EES receive a charge from EWS for the entire second quarter.
Unless I hear strong objection to this, we will work toward a July 1, 2001 cutover.

"
0,"This mail is the third in the series regarding the acceptance of RiskTrac VaR for UK Power.
Please see the previous 2 days which will provide the history.
Essentially we have now reached the stage where we can explain the jump in VaR from moving from the VaR spread sheet to RiskTrac based largely on the good work that Fergus Trenholme - London Risk Management and Stig Faltinsen - London Research have done  (it has been a team effort as many others have been called in as appropriate and I would like to thank them too).
A full analysis is contained in the note from Fergus and Stig below but the key points to note are:  the changing of the input parameters partially explains the difference in the VAR number between the 2 systems but not completely (including the change in factor loadings) the vast majority of the difference in the VAR numbers between the 2 systems is caused by the splitting of the volumetric position into the (primary and secondary) component curves in RiskTrac.
In RiskTrac PPP is currently set as the primary curve even though 75% of the position is on the station gate curve where as in the spreadsheet the whole position is against the PPP curve  As a result of us now being able to isolate and explain the jump in VaR from moving to RiskTrac we will be reporting this number from now on.
That said does the VaR number sound right ?
The numer is theoretically but is the theory close to reality in the Uk Power market ?The RiskTrac calculated $25m VaR is a 1 day VaR and the  methodology would imply it should be broken 1 in 20 business days.
Based on historical P&Ls this has not been the case and so it does not pass the ""sense check"".
(note that the original $13m VaR was only broken once or twice in the last year).
There are many potential explanations why, but if we think about how the price and volatility curves move they typically only move at the short end (ie only the first 2 years) and the component VarR for this period is in the order of $8m.
This could therefore imply that the volatilities we are using to calculate the VaR are too high.
The book undoubtedly contains significant risk but due to market illiquidity more consideration should be given to ""jumps"" or ""shocks"".
The book does posses increased fat tail risk at this lower VaR level which is not  captured in the current VaR calculation.
Outstanding issues / work  Based on the second bullet point above consideration needs to be given to changing the primary and secondary curve settings as well as the correlations and factor loadings for and between all the curves.
The impact of any such changes will need to be quantified.
Fergus and Stig aim to work with Houston research and the business on this over the next few days / week(s) and will be providing a regular update to those on this mail list.
Additional work needs to done to assess whether the VaR  number  / methodology being calculated / employed by RiskTrac truly represents the expected volatility and performance of the portfolio and truly represents the 1 day earnings risk for 19 out of 20 days.
It would also be appropriate, given the nature of the market and the term structure of the portfolio, to assess the fat tail risk being run.
I am away for the next 2 weeks so Fergus and Stig will be sending regular progress updates.

The information regarding Oklahoma that I told you I'd look into actually ended up being a center for Weather Research that was being sponsored by Williams not our weather group.
Scholarship There are a couple of different scholarship and fundraising initiatives underway that are being driven by Enron employees and alumni of the individual universities employed here.
They take advantage of matching funds and are administered by employees here with some assistance by Community Relations and University Affairs.
If you are interested in organizing an effort like this for Oklahoma, let me know and I can work with you on the details.

I'm sorry to have missed it!
Girls Inc. would love to have an Enron exec on their board and I wanted to see if that is something you are interested in doing.
If so, I can get you detailed information about the board commitment, etc.
Let me know what you think.

0,"As I look back on the ten months that I have been the Business Controller for EIM and challenged to build the mid and back office infrastructure, the most significant accomplishments are:  Systems - Tactical systems have been implemented to bridge the business while strategic systems are developed.
Financial and physical confirmations (with the exception of Lumber) have been predominantly automated.
Financial settlements has been automated.
Implemented modified versions of LISA to handle physical movements and settlements.
Bridges have been built to SAP and Credit Aggregation systems.
People - Ten months ago, the mid and back office had three employees, with the remaining efforts supported by Global Markets.
Today, we have an enthusiastic, energetic team of 41 employees.
The team includes our London office also.
We continue to recruit for additional positions.
Processes and Controls - Many processes and controls have been developed to ensure accurate and timely reporting of P&L and positions, confirmations and settlements.
Some of these tools include: Pulp and Paper Deal Ticket (Access Database) - Ten months ago, deal tickets were generated through an Excel template and no master copy or controls were in place.
Today, traders, Risk, Confirms, Settlements, Credit, Logistics, etc.
can view the deal tickets in a controlled and timely manner.
LISA/TAGG Reconciliation (Access Database) - When the onset of physical business and the implementation of LISA systems, physical transactions for all commodities (except lumber) are entered into 2 systems - LISA and TAGG.
This tool provides a reconciliation tool that allows the Risk system and the logistics/settlements systems to stay in sync.
Trader Training Tools - Two different presentations have been developed and presented to the EIM trading community to help the traders (mostly new to Enron) understand the roles and responsibilities of traders, segregation of duties and the processes within Commercial Support functions such as Credit, Tax, Legal, Operations, Logistics, etc.
Sally, I hope this will give the flavor of the focused efforts.
Additionally, as I have had a few hours to reflect on our conversation, I would like to follow-up with an additional meeting.
I need just a bit more clarity around the EIM role, but more so, I want to move forward to discuss the new role and in your view, how I can still accomplish the successes that coincide with my personal goals.
If you have time tomorrow afternonn, I would really appreciate 30 minutes.
Thanks for your support.
It means alot to me.

0,"Hi,  I just came across following discussion on Economics that provides an interesting insight.
Economic philosophies explained in terms of two cows: Socialism - You have two cows.
You give one to your neighbor.
Communism - You have two cows.
The government takes both and gives you milk.
Fascism - You have two cows.
The government takes them both and sells you the milk.
Capitalism - You have two cows.
You sell one and buy a bull.
Bureaucracy - You have two cows.
The government takes them both, shoots one,  milks the other, pays you for the milk , then pours it down the drain.
Corporate - You have two cows.
You downsize one, then require the other one to produce the milk of four cows, then act surprised when it falls dead.
Democracy - You have two cows.
You are taxed to the point where you have to sell them both so that the government can support a man in a foreign country who has one cow, which was a gift from your country.
Hope you enjoyed.

0,"Mike & Sally,  Below is the information that we received on the project.
I am still waiting on a cost center from EES for the expense portions to settle to.
Look over this information and let me know if you still want to meet to go over this.
This is the EES project, which is set up on EES to capture the capital portion of the project costs.
The expense portion should settle to an EES cost center.
The project set up shown below is the Networks project, which I set up, but have not yet released.
Only Release 1 is shown below.
There are three releases set up, but only the first one will be released at this time.
All three releases or phases will look like the other phases.
As you can see below, the capital parts of the project (Solution Definition, Design & Build, and Implementation & Testing) are set up with three basic WBS elements.
These elements as described below will settle to the EES project as follows.
Project Coding on Networks Project					Settles to EES Project WBS C.300000.01.SD.OU	Rel 1 SD Outside Consultants Labor		C.007730.22.01 Outside Professional C.300000.01.SD.EN	Rel 1 SD Enron Labor				C.007730.22.03 Enron Labor C.300000.01.SD.OE	Rel 1 SD Other Expenditures			C.007730.22.05 Other Expenditure  C.300000.01.HW Hardware Purchases					C.007730.24.01 Hardware C.300000.01.SW Software Purchases				            C.007730.24.02 Software  This will allow the costs on the Networks project to be tracked in a manor that will support how the charges are settling to EES.
So if EES has any questions about the charges we should be able to pull up the detail very quickly.
The following items will settle to an EES cost center since they are expense related.
C.300000.01.PI.TR	Rel 1 PI Training Dev & Delivery   C.300000.01.PI.PI	Rel 1 PI Post Implementation Support   C.300000.01.PI.GA	Rel 1 PI General & Administrative

The data is being reviewed both internally and externally.
The form and substance of the data we have requested, the due diligence questionnaires, and Enron's previously produced forms of data are excellent proxies for the information that will be required from us when a specific bank is chosen to structure and execute the anticipated transaction.
However, I am certain that we will still require your commitment to providing updates, clarifications, and additions on a timely basis.

0,"Sally, some thoughts/ideas that I thought about after your meeting.
Lets promote the positive - some very exciting things are happening such as the move to the new building, lets make sure we get the PR out there to talk about the new features, move in plans, etc.
I know security is tight but how about a mini open house.
At this point it would do us good to go beyond the ""Building Guy"".
I know I get excited whenever I'm over there.
Things like vendors in the lobby to push new technology etc.
I believe it's important to keep that almost ""electric"" atmosphere that surrounds the company.
Lets show our employees that our outside business relationships are as strong as ever and our vendors/business partners still view Enron as someone they are eager to continue doing business with.
I always get charged up when the lobby is full of activity.
Keeps the pulse of Enron at a high level.
Get some fun things out there, things the employees can purchase, electronic devices are always attractive.
Work out a decent discount to make it exciting.
Give it a holiday twist.
Even if it costs us a few bucks to make that happen might be worth it.
Make a push to host more industry meetings (GISB is one that I can help with).
Lets get our counterparties in here and let them know nothing has changed.
We can include mini tours of the new building to get the word back on the street about how we might be down but boy are we poised to grow, grow and grow some more.
I mentioned to you that I believe it's important for the Executive team to show up often to reassure our employees that yes there are real, caring people running this company.
Maybe some impromptu floor meetings to talk about recent events.
Let them feel like there is a real connection.
Make it personal and regular.
Thanks for listening, the sense from my group has been okay.
Lots of concerns but nobody running out the door at this point.
I'll keep you posted.

NCL, Inc. at www.nationalcharityleague.org   will be the umbrella site.
Each  chapter that participates will have a web site under this umbrella.
The name will be www.nationalcharityleague/chaptername.org .
The chapters will be given a choice of 4  templates that will allow them to pick colors and graphics that they like.
Each chapter site will contain: 1.
A  front page:  a brief section about  their chapter that can be reached by anyone searching for National Charity  League.
This will be the only  public area.
2.
A  password entry area that will be based on the chapter database or list of  members that they want to have access to their site.
The password entry area will have an  area that members can update their information (change of address, e-mail,  etc.).
3.
The  password protected area will include: a.
A member listing with address, phone numbers, etc.
b.       Philanthropies and schedules for activities c.        Calendar d.       Meeting Schedule (Patroness and Ticktocker) e.        Newsletters f.         Bylaws (searchable by keyword) g.        Ticktocker Procedures (searchable by keyword) h.        Standing Rules (searchable by keyword) i.
Hours (this will be a database collection area that each chapter member  will be allowed to submit hours through.
The hours chair(s) will be able to ask for and get a report of all hours  submitted.
The individual members  will also be able to get a summary of their hours as well.
j.
And finally, a chat area for chapter members.
The cost:  A  one-time site set-up fee of approximately $500 (this could be slightly more due  to the uncertainty of additional information that chapters may want on their  site) and a $69.95 per month web hosting fee.
I will train the chapter designated person on how to load  their information onto the web area via a manual that I will prepare and at  convention and phone calls.
Our  service provider will handle technical support for non-NCL content related  problems.
Once the templates are  designed and tested, chapter sites could be ready for uploading within 2  weeks.
The template design and  testing will be done over the next several months if there is sufficient  commitment from chapters.
I'll pick  a date of January 1, 2002 for chapter sites to be ready.
It could be sooner but I have to make  sure that there are enough chapters interested before committing my time to this  project.
I can't think of anything else on this subject.

As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here.
We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks.
Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.
NEC Monitors The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.
Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.
Turret Users An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".
Increased Information Access There are approximately 65 NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 3rd floor.
While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.
The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.
Here's how:  Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.
The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.
To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:   Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	 Weather Channel	12401	801	 CNN Headlines News	12402	802	 CNN Financial News	12403	803	 CNN	12404	804	 CNBC	12405	805	 MSNBC	12406	806	 Financial News Network	12407	807	 Bloomberg	12408	808	 Fox Sports	12409	809	 ESPN1	12410	810	  Wireless Telephony You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.
We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.
Wireless LAN The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested.
We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.
Amtel Replacement As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging.
We are testing an additional software product to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, message logging and printing.
This system is being tested within the environment and will be available in the next few weeks.

0,"I want to move forward with scheduling the initial meeting of the Operational Risk Management task force.
How does Tuesday, October 16th and the afternoon of Thursday, October 18th look for everyone?
Please let me know your schedule for both of these dates.
Most of the task force members have been identified, with the exception of those from GRMO and IT.
Sally Beck will identify representatives from these two areas.
I would also expect that other individuals may be consulted from time to time as additional expertise or resources or required.
I intend to schedule a two-hour block of time for this meeting.
The agenda will include, at a minimum,  the following topics:  	Definition of Operational Risk for  Enron - What's in and What's Out 	Preliminary Goals for Operational Risk Management (to be refined by the group) 	     Develop Common Language                  Identify Framework for Monitoring Risk 	     Role of this task force  - Strategy 	     Set common objectives for implementation this year and a look forward to 2002 	Current Initiatives 	Communications Plan  	Open Discussion - Other Ideas from the group  			  - Suggestions re other groups/individuals to include on the task force 	  I am excited about leading this initiative for Enron.
We have a unique opportunity to define operational risk measurement for Enron, develop reporting guidelines, and provide qualitative assessments of operational risk, all of which will be considered during the risk capital allocation process.
But most importantly, we can identify ways to mitigate Enron's exposure to operational risk.
Please call if you would like to discuss any of the above prior to the meeting.
Thanks,

0,"Based on the suggestion made in Sally Beck's last staff meeting, we have modified the Enron Reward Bucks program to include the recognition of Managers.
With regards to the process, you will continue to utilize the nomination form for Sr.
Specialist and below and follow the same criteria.
When ordering future debit cards, we recommend you include denominations of $150 and $200 to handle the additional recognition.
In the interim, when nominating a Manager, you can combine denominations to equal the amount you are interested in rewarding (for example; 1-$100 and 1-$50 card or 2-$100 cards).
We are not suggesting that you award at this amount, however it is available to use at your discretion.
The Enron Reward Bucks maximize at $200, where PBAs generally range from $200-$2000 though with committee approval can range higher.
These programs are intended to compliment each other and we encourage you to utilize them to recognize and reward your team.
We will continue to evaluate these programs and make changes as needed from both a business and employee perspective.
Please feel free to contact your HR representative if you have further questions on the programs or recommendations on how they can be improved.
Please share this with your staff.

0,"We have surpassed the Enron 2001 minimum commitment spend of $8,000,000 with EDS.
We would not have met our commitment without being creative and asking EDS to purchase $5,000,000 worth of flat screens for use in Enron Center South.
In 2002 we once again have an $8,000,000 ""take or pay"" commitment.
Currently, we have approximately $3,000,000 worth of 2002 EDS utilization commitments from various Enron business units.
Which means we will need another $5,000,000 worth of creative EDS spend in 2002.
After 2002 the Enron spend commitment to EDS is $5,000,000 per year with no set contract termination.
My understanding is that the way in which the original financing deal with EDS was booked deters us from ending our relationship with EDS.
Please find the details attached.

0,"As you are all aware, the latest Risk Management Policy specifically addresses Operational Risk, and more specifically commits Enron to develop systems and processes that enable Enron to better evaluate its operational risk.
To that end, I have asked Wanda Curry to lead a cross-functional team (the ""Operational Risk Committee""), which will be jointly accountable for meeting this commitment.
I would like to have representatives from Enron Assurance Services, RAC, Research, Information Technology, GRMO and Arthur Anderson.
Enron's primary objective for monitoring its exposure to operational risk is to (a) identify the derivation of operational risk exposures and (b) improve the Company's systems and processes to mitigate such risk.
The guidelines for operational risk assessment are essentially undeveloped.
It will be our challenge to identify, assess, categorize, quantify and mitigate exposure to operational risk.
The risk capital allocation process includes the consideration of operational risk.
Initially, this assessment will be based on a qualitative view of the business unit's internal processes, people and systems.
The initial goal, for completion prior to year-end 2001, is to establish a baseline and/or report card to convey a sense for where we are now.
It is Enron's objective, as reflected in the Risk Management Policy, to increase the sophistication of risk measurement for operational risks through documented qualitative assessments and quantitative measurements.
A list of additional objectives to be addressed by the cross functional team has been prepared by Wanda.
These include: 	 Develop a qualitative operational risk assessment approach and implement.
This approach should enable a quick review of key functions and standards to identify weaknesses, monitor progress over time, and provide management with a representation of operational risk.
Assess and improve integrity of daily risk reports, i.e.
require confirmation that all books are captured, aggregated and processed through RisktRAC, CreditAg, and Infinity applications Ascertain the extent of spreadsheet usage across Enron and develop the ability to monitor NOP, V@R, and MTM for spreadsheets separately, i.e.
a Spreadsheet DPR.
Work with GRMO to develop ""rules of use"" for financial valuation models and spreadsheet ""books"" Utilize the existing RMS database and develop the ability to monitor intercompany - interbook activity (initially for forward positions only) and report variances  Recommend metrics for quantitative measurement of operational risk Access need for additional or improved risk databases  Wanda will be contacting each of you to identify your designated operational risk contact that will participate on this cross-functional team.
Thanks,

1,"Sally / Bill / Shawn  This is a quick note to let you know that as of Monday 1 October Enron Europe will be introducing a robust New Account Opening Policy for all trading counterparties.
The Operational Credit team will be responsible for ensuring the smooth roll-out of the policy and for ensuring compliance with it.
The salient points of the policy are that:  traders will be more accountable for relevant Regulatory and internal compliance concerning their counterparties; money laundering checks will be completed for all new counterparties prior to trading; the Compliance Group will give sign off for all new counterparties prior to trading; RAC will give sign off for all new counterparties prior to trading.
These controls are already in place for the majority of Enron Europe's counterparties, however, the introduction of the Policy enables us to demonstrate this more effectively to the Regulators and to monitor compliance more easily.
I attach the policy below.
If you have any questions pls give me a call on +44 7783 5261.
Thanks   -   Sam

0,"As you both are aware (not publicly) we are 'right-sizing' again.
This will impact EBS's requirement for services from ENW.
We are finalizing the revised 2002 'look' and it's not pretty.
Confidentially, we will be significantly lower than the 440 we have at present.
As far as I predict right now we'll need the following:  IT Development/Systems  I've met with Inja and asked her to plan for 'minimal maintenance mode' - no development - by 1/1/02.
I've asked her to shoot for no higher than $2m - from $11.2m.
I realize this will involve potential periods of down-time and very thin coverage - unfortunately it's all we can afford.
Inga came back at $1.95m - wihout herself - however, we will need a strong leader - and I've asked her to look at anyway she can stay involved/manage what is going to be a lot of 'no, sorry can't do that' conversations.
This covers upkeep of EnFiber, NETS, EComms, Remedy, PPCS, Fact and all our DB requirements.
IT Infrastructure  I've gave Jenny/Kerry a heads-up of around 300 folks for 2002 a couple of weeks ago - we will be lower.
Our space and IT requirements will be lower accordingly.
We will based out of Houston with a Shepherd warehouse.
No Europe/Asia support can be assumed.
We will also not require EOL.
Let me know what I get for 'not much to spend'.
Energy Ops  Currently at $5m supporting 36 folks.
This will be trimmed to 17 folks.
We will also need a small Contract Admin support level from Pat W's team.
That's a heads-up.
Sorry it's such unpleasent news.

Brenda Herod is the operations controller for EIM.

I did hear an unsubstantiated rumor this week that Clickpaper.com is set to  go live in London within 5 days.
I am trying to find out if that is true.
If it is, it would be a repeat of a commercial decision in Houston to do so  this past July without letting anyone in the mid and back office know.
We  had to scramble to set up an infrastructure to support that in a big hurry.
Not ideal.
I hope that history has not repeated itself.

Frank is working on a contract basis at this  time, and Sheila Walton is seeking feedback on his performance to date in  order to evaluate the duration of his work as a contractor and the  feasibility of bringing him in as an employee.
I have given Sheila my  feedback, but suggested to her that you may have had more contact with Frank  than I have had.

Both the morning  Analyst PRC meeting and the Associates PRC meeting were scheduled for the  same location and with Joe Sutton as chair.

I will let you know as  soon as I know a rescheduled date.
In preparation for today's PRC meeting, I was able to meet in person with  most of your supervisors to get input on your job responsiblities,  accomplishments and performance.
For those that were unavailable for a  meeting, we managed a phone call or at least a series of voice mails to  accomplish the same thing.
I also have any materials that you may have  provided to your supervisor for the mid-year review process, as well as  copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the PEP system.
With this delay in the meeting date, I have the time to ask for a copy of  your resume.
The PRC process clearly focuses on your performance  specifically from January through June 2000.
However, it would be helpful to  me in representing you to at least be familiar with your backgrounds.
Please  e:mail a copy to me or you can send a hard copy to EB3015.

I let Nikki know about a rescheduled date from Rick's PRC last week.
I don't  think that there had been any widespread communication about the new date of  June 27.

Will you also be back for the meeting on June 27?
Before you left for vacation I had tried to reach you regarding the MG  acquisition.
That should make life fun for you!
I wanted to talk about  resources and how I might be able to help in both the further due diligence  efforts and longer term in the assimilation.
As in my voice mail, I believe  that a doorstep review of trading locations would be critical, both from a  controls perspective and from the perspective of an up close view of how they  run their business.
It seems that might help jump start the plans around how  best to assimilate the business.
I had suggested my new hire, Shona Wilson,  as a potential resource and then there are several of us who have already  been involved in doorstep reviews that could be involved both in the US and  in other locations.
Brent has forwarded a memo to me from Naomi Connell  who  seems to be formulating a plan for the doorstep reviews.
I don't know the  names that she mentions (other than Tani Nath), and I am sure that she is  unaware of additional resources from Houston that could be used.
We can  hopefully talk about that tomorrow morning.

0,"While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made  at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.
In  talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University  of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an  internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for  summer 2001 interns.
I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her  manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay  interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's  staffing.
When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the  practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more  concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.
It would  seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern  interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for  Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for  our Analyst and Associates programs.
I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with  no resolution.
When they could not provide the competitive data to either  confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a   Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.
Lexi and Shelley  either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do  so.
They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this  critical information.
I now have information at hand with regard to firms  that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.
And based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring  top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for  these positions this fall.
While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits,  I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all  campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.
As administrators of the  program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to  carry the Enron message to campus.
I believe that we also have an obligation  to make this a two-way messaging system.
I strongly believe that we must  address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on  campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.
I  suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of  the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer  internships.
In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive  sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the  decision on interviewing summer interns.
I have copied both of them on this  note to the two of you.
Please let me know how this can be resolved.
With the help of James Scribner  and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that  should be targeted for summer internships.
I will offer as much of my time  as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative  ways to turn this around.

Is this one of  the corrections that was made to the June information?
Any update on July?
Thanks.

0,"The Enron-wide PRC meeting to review the mid-year performance for all Vice  Presidents has been rescheduled several times.
Currently, this meeting is  set for September 11 and 12.
Per David Oxley, performance reviews for Vice  Presidents should be conducted after this PRC process is completed.
Assuming  that the meeting takes place as now planned in September, I will schedule  your reviews sometime after September 12.
(Bob, I will assume that your  review will be given by Rock, but I will keep you informed on this process  along with Peggy and Brent.)
On another note, Enron hosts an annual management conference each year for  Vice President level and above.
You should all receive invitations to this  event.
In recent years, it has been held in San Antonio.
I do not know the  location for this year, but I do have the dates for you to hold on your  calendars:  November 15-17.
Let me know if you have any questions on either one of these.

0,"I received the note about the Wellesley recruiting team meeting on Thursday.
I will look forward to seeing you there.
Will you be in Dallas next week for the ASE?
I will be there.
I did let  Melissa know when the dates were announced that I will quietly slip out about  mid afternoon on Thursday.
Amanda's school open house is Thursday at 7:00,  and parents will follow their children's schedules and meet all of the  teachers.
With this being Amanda's   first year in junior high, it is  important for me to meet the teachers and understand their expectations so  that I can best support her in school.
Mary Solmonson and Brent from my team  will be there for the duration.
I look forward to seeing you there, too!

1,"Beth Perlman tells me that you are in charge on this system.
It does not  work.
I thought that this was going to be corrected last week.
I am  confused about why we are using a system that does not work.
I understand  that there are bugs in the system.
Was the system tested before being put  into production?
I tried to reach you by phone.
You were unavailable and I could not leave a  voice mail because that was full.
I talked with Torey Hayden and verbally  okayed the access for Bob Hall.
Please call me and let me know when the system will be working correctly and  how you are going to manage these approvals in the interim while the system  is not functioning.
You might at least put a contact name and number on  these things if you are going to continue to send these out before the system  is fixed.
My number is 35926.
I look forward to hearing from you on solutions and  timing.

1,"I met with Karen Marshall today.
She is in the Community Relations group and  is organizing the dinner on September 7th.
I suggested that she add to the  invitation list the other interviewers this year for the scholarships (Roger  Ondreko and Gene Humphrey), Brent Price and Loftis Fitzwater (one of last  year's scholarhip recepients who started with us as an Associate this  summer).
I have also volunteered to coordinate with the University on  appropriate attendees, as some of Karen's info is dated and she does not know  people at the school.
I will keep you posted.

I would fly over on the afternoon of the 7th and back on  the morning of the 8th.
Check with Karen to see if she is handling hotel  reservations, or if we should make those.
Thanks.

My husband is scheduled for a baseball game on  Wednesday night.
If I could find some Diamond level tickets for another day  for him, he might consider giving up his tickets for Wednesday night.
This  is a last resort sort of measure, however, so I hope that you find success in  response from others.
But do let me know...

1,"I am resending this memo regarding the information that I need from you as  Cheryl Ingstad's supervisor as I prepare to represent her in the Associates  PRC meeting next week.
I am tied up in other PRC meetings on December 7, 8  and 11, so I am doing my homework earlier rather than later this week.
Please note the bullet points in the memo below which outline the information  that I need.
I do have copies of the internal feedback forms and Cheryl's  self-evaluation.
Let me know if you have any questions.
I know that things  are very busy right now, but it is important to the Associates that their  reps in the PRC process are well prepared.
Your input will help me with  that.
Thanks.

0,"Sorry that I missed you this morning.
I attended that last Financial Council  meeting on SAP this morning just prior to my lunch meeting with Mark Frevert  and Rick Causey.
Nothing substantial came up on Helsinki, so it was fine  that we didn't get to talk today.
I had wanted to be prepared on how to  address out current activities there.
So I can get an update on that when we  talk tomorrow.
I have a meeting on the analyst and associates program from 9:00 to 10:00  tomorrow.
I will call you around 10:00 when I get back from that meeting.

0,"As we said before, I would like to be able to utilize Todd Hall for special  projects from time to time.
I had mentioned to Mike Jordan that once Todd  completed his CommodityLogic role that I thought that we could take some of  his time to follow up on Continental Power issues, which could fit nicely  with some work he could do on Weather in Europe.
I don't know about the one  month timeframe.
I would prefer that Todd review the initiatives and  determine the best way to proceed.
It might mean a couple of weeks over  there for starters, and then a follow up, shorter trip a few weeks later.
I  don't think that Todd is keen on any elongated stays in Europe, particularly  without the family.
Can we still use Todd ?

0,"Rick:  This is a draft of the language to be used in a McConnell/Shankman  memo to go out on their new organization.
I worked with Mike on the language  for this paragraph.
Any comments or suggested changes?
Mike would like to send this out ASAP, ideally this afternoon.
Thanks for  taking a look.
draft  Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President of  Operations and Chief Accounting Officer.
He will report to the EGM Office of  the Chairman, and to Sally Beck, Vice President of Global Risk Management  Operations.

Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila  Glover, business controller for Global Financial Products;  Todd Hall,  business controller for Weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for  Global Products and Coal.

1,"I have been able to move up the meeting with Mark Frevert regarding  responsibility for operations for ENA, EGM and EEL to Thursday, August 17  instead of August 28.
I will keep you posted.
I met with Brent's direct reports yesterday afternoon and announced Brent's  new role.
I will have three persons leading the natural gas team:  Steve  Jackson, Leslie Reeves and Bob Hall.
I am confident that this will work  well.

0,"FYI:  Rick agreed with the attached note that I sent him.
By voice mail, I  suggested Ted Murphy as a substitute for Rick Buy for the meeting.
We are  set for next Thursday, August 17 at 11:45 in Rick Causey's office over  lunch.
I am meeting with Ted this afternoon to fill him in on the purpose of  the meeting and to be certain that I have his support.
Rick Causey suggested  citing some of the items in my memo to him when we get with Frevert.
Any  words of wisdom or suggestions for the meeting?
Hope that everything is fun and relaxing in Maine.

Please return this request to the person who  originated it so that the Manager section can be completed.
By including the  manager's name, that will help me to identify who this person is, what job  they perform and whether or not the request makes sense.
I have over 400  people in my group, so without more detail on these requests it is not worth  taking my time to approve these.

I am especially  proud of the accomplishments of Energy Operations in supporting this growth.
I wanted to express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that  you have demonstrated.
We have done great work and I want to recognize you  for that.
Although we have done much, we have additional goals to accomplish within ENA  and Energy Operations this year.
Therefore, as we go forward, I want to make  sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the best possible job, and  that any barriers that may impede your work are removed.
To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization -- S.J.

The judge believes that we can conclude the trial by end of the day on  Wednesday or perhaps on Thursday.
I will be back here working after trial  hours in the office and checking voice mail messages during breaks in the  proceedings.
I will be back full time as soon as my civic duty is  fulfilled!
Enron is well presented in the court system over the next few days.
I sat by  Mark Koenig in the jury assembly room today, and he too was chosen to serve  on another jury.
