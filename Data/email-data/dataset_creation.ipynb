      "To all of our esteemed & prized Internet Banking  (IBS) Clients:  You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls (or e-mails).\n",
      "We really do but have been holed up trying to complete this project ASAP.\n",
      "We knew that this might upset some clients, but we found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our users back on-line.\n",
      "We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #).\n",
      "This process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100 IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected.\n",
      "After verifying data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track.\n",

      "Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and ourselves) do not have to go through this process again.\n",

      "Liane,   As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to  manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.\n",
      "A single buyer entered the  marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices  ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.\n",
      "At the  time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15  cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to  report into the index calculation.\n",
      "Additionally, these trades are out of  line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.\n",
      "We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from  September 25 to September 27.\n",
      "These are the complete list of trades from  Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage  firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).\n",
      "Please see the attached spreadsheet for a  trade by trade list and a summary.\n",
      "We have also included a summary of gas  daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread  relationships.\n",
      "The two key points from this data are as follows:   1.\n",
      "The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater  than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &  Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and         October gas daily.\n",
      "It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that  are dramatically different.\n",
      "I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.\n",
      "Hopefully, the  trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to  determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are  outliers.\n",
      "I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in  establishing a reasonable index.\n",
      "It is Enron's belief that the trades at  $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the  calculation of index.\n",
      "It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to  conduct our physical and financial business.\n",
      "Please contact me  anytime I can assist you towards this goal.\n",
      "Sincerely,\n",

      "Gentlemen  I wanted to provide you an update on the status of the Refco private label platform deal.\n",
      "We have had several meetings since I first presented the idea to you all.\n",
      "Unfortunately, Refco's headquarters was in One World Financial Center which was severely damaged by debris from the World Trade Center collapse.\n",
      "They suffered no human losses from the disaster, but their offices are off limits and all their computers and paper files are inaccessible for the time being.\n",
      "They are up and running out of a Jersey City location with some back up capability.\n",
      "To briefly summarize the discussion so far, ENW would build a Refco branded platform similar to EOL that would be accessed by Refco's customers.\n",
      "Enron would provide transactable prices to the site with wider spreads and potentially smaller minimum volumes.\n",
      "Refco customers would transact on the site with Refco as their counterparty and Refco would sleeve the transactions to Enron allowing us to consolidate our credit risk to a singular credit, Refco.\n",
      "The products contemplated include various Nymex look-a-like products and other liquid swaps in oil, natural gas, and electricity.\n",
      "Revenue would come to Enron in the form of license fees for the platform, transaction fees, and origination from the additional volume create by the wider margin products.\n",
      "Revenue would come to Refco in the form of transaction fees.\n",
      "Refco has a similar arrangement in place for FX with Dresner bank and have announced a similar platform for bonds and securities with Cantor Fitzgerald/E-speed.\n",
      "All that being said, they are anxious to move the discussion forward and we have planned a visit for them to come to Houston in 2 weeks.\n",
      "Attending will be Gary Weiss, SVP Refco Group Ltd. LLC and President & CEO of Refco F/X Ltd LLC, and Joe Murphy, CEO Refco Futures Ltd. LLC.\n",
      "The purpose of this visit is for them to give us a presentation on the Refco Group of companies, discuss the products and estimations of revenue streams based on their current futures business, and discuss the possible structure of the deal.\n",
      "The meeting is scheduled to begin at 2:30pm Thursday Oct 4 and expected to last the balance of the day and possibly into the next morning.\n",
      "I will approach you all individually to get your feedback on how you would like to interact with them and when.\n",
      "I realize there are significant issues to be addressed.\n",
      "Refco currently has some 175,000 collateralized customer accounts ranging from Institutional Investors & locals down to individuals.\n",
      "We have put these into 2 buckets which have different profiles.\n",
      "Phase 1 would include the Top 2000 accounts which are largely substantial institutional investors, locals, and high net worth individuals.\n",
      "If this proves successful, phase 2 would be rolled out with products designed to attract activity from the smaller investors.\n",
      "The idea would be to automate the products as much as is practical.\n",
      "Mark Tayor in Legal has already spoken with their counsel and is comfortable that they have reviewed all the legal angles thoroughly.\n",
      "Refco advises that if the have accounts back up by collateral guaranteed by them, they become Eligible Contract Participants (ECPs) able to execute derivatives.\n",
      "So, they believe that the majority of the 175,000 accounts they have could be ECPs for the purposes of this deal.\n",
      "Credit is reviewing the Refco financials and we plan to discuss this thoroughly during their visit.\n",
      "Please do not hesitate to contact me at x36413 if you have any questions or comments and I will be getting in touch with you early next week to get your feedback.\n",

      "A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a \"peoples choice\" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).\n",

      "Simply put, we need quotes on every forward term for which we currently have positions.\n",
      "It seems that the best way to obtain relevant information would be to ask for the following:  1.\n",
      "Annual quotes (a quote for 2003, a quote for 2004, etc.)\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Seasonal quotes (winter '03, summer '04, etc.)\n",
      "In short, try to obtain pricing to match any positions which we currently have in the books.\n",
      "I know that this will be difficult to accomplish, but please do what you can.\n",
      "We need these quotes for every day starting with Nov 28 through today.\n",
      "We will continue to need daily updates for the immediate future.\n",
      "Also, I am aware that our current position doesn't give us much stroke to ask for a lot of pricing data.\n",
      "However, this information is critical as it will be needed for calculation of termination values.\n",
      "Please do whatever you can to obtain as much data as possible.\n",
      "Additionally, we need to get quotes from as many different brokers as possible to help verify pricing.\n",
      "Please let me know if the brokers are not accomodating your requests; we may need to ask John or Louise to place calls into the brokers to move this process along.\n",
      "If you have any questions or comments, you can normally find me in the \"war room\" next to Louise's office.\n",

      "The Board changed the proposed method for determining the amount of goodwill to be included in the net assets to be disposed of.\n",
      "Under the new method, a portion of the reporting unit's goodwill will be allocated to all divestitures.\n",

      "additionally, the calculation itself is arbitrary and onerous in that fair values of the reporting unit and its recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities will have to be determined each time a divestiture is done.\n",

      "A full analysis is contained in the note from Fergus and Stig below but the key points to note are:  the changing of the input parameters partially explains the difference in the VAR number between the 2 systems but not completely (including the change in factor loadings) the vast majority of the difference in the VAR numbers between the 2 systems is caused by the splitting of the volumetric position into the (primary and secondary) component curves in RiskTrac.\n",
      "In RiskTrac PPP is currently set as the primary curve even though 75% of the position is on the station gate curve where as in the spreadsheet the whole position is against the PPP curve  As a result of us now being able to isolate and explain the jump in VaR from moving to RiskTrac we will be reporting this number from now on.\n",
      "That said does the VaR number sound right ?\n",
      "The numer is theoretically but is the theory close to reality in the Uk Power market ?The RiskTrac calculated $25m VaR is a 1 day VaR and the  methodology would imply it should be broken 1 in 20 business days.\n",
      "Based on historical P&Ls this has not been the case and so it does not pass the \"sense check\".\n",
      "(note that the original $13m VaR was only broken once or twice in the last year).\n",
      "There are many potential explanations why, but if we think about how the price and volatility curves move they typically only move at the short end (ie only the first 2 years) and the component VarR for this period is in the order of $8m.\n",
      "This could therefore imply that the volatilities we are using to calculate the VaR are too high.\n",
      "The book undoubtedly contains significant risk but due to market illiquidity more consideration should be given to \"jumps\" or \"shocks\".\n",
      "The book does posses increased fat tail risk at this lower VaR level which is not  captured in the current VaR calculation.\n",
      "Outstanding issues / work  Based on the second bullet point above consideration needs to be given to changing the primary and secondary curve settings as well as the correlations and factor loadings for and between all the curves.\n",
      "The impact of any such changes will need to be quantified.\n",
      "Fergus and Stig aim to work with Houston research and the business on this over the next few days / week(s) and will be providing a regular update to those on this mail list.\n",
      "Additional work needs to done to assess whether the VaR  number  / methodology being calculated / employed by RiskTrac truly represents the expected volatility and performance of the portfolio and truly represents the 1 day earnings risk for 19 out of 20 days.\n",
      "It would also be appropriate, given the nature of the market and the term structure of the portfolio, to assess the fat tail risk being run.\n",
      "I am away for the next 2 weeks so Fergus and Stig will be sending regular progress updates.\n",

      "While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made  at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.\n",
      "In  talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University  of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an  internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for  summer 2001 interns.\n",
      "I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her  manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay  interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's  staffing.\n",
      "When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the  practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more  concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.\n",
      "It would  seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern  interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for  Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for  our Analyst and Associates programs.\n",
      "I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with  no resolution.\n",
      "When they could not provide the competitive data to either  confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a   Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.\n",
      "Lexi and Shelley  either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do  so.\n",
      "They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this  critical information.\n",
      "I now have information at hand with regard to firms  that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.\n",

      "While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits,  I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all  campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.\n",
      "As administrators of the  program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to  carry the Enron message to campus.\n",
      "I believe that we also have an obligation  to make this a two-way messaging system.\n",
      "I strongly believe that we must  address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on  campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.\n",

      "First, who is Doug Imrie?\n",
      "Does he  have a strong background in trading operations?\n",
      "Will he be  able to  coordinate effective reviews from a controls perspective, and will he be able  to be the front-runner on how MG runs its business so that we will get a jump  start on how best to assimilate the business?\n",
      "I think that this effort  should be much broader than deal testing.\n",
      "It should encompass assessing  people, processes, controls, systems support, etc.\n",
      "To do this quickly and  effectively will require persons who are knowledgeable about daily trading  operations.\n",
      "I don't know Naomi's background, but I wonder if she will be  the right person to lead one of these efforts since she does not work in  operations on a daily basis.\n",

      "Background:  As a long-time supporter of the analyst program, I became  concerned over the last several months as frustration emerged from other  supporters of the program.\n",
      "Many of those expressing frustration are heavily  involved in the recruiting process.\n",
      "It is their commitment to both  recruiting and providing analyst rotations that has been key in attracting  talented candidates to what has been the Merchant Services Analyst Program.\n",
      "I initiated a meeting, announced at Rick Causey's staff meeting, that would  bring us together so that we could consolidate our concerns and then discuss  them with you in a constructive manner.\n",
      "Our intent is continued support and  improvement of the program.\n",
      "The meeting took place on March 28 and included  the following:   Brenda Herod   ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - LSU   Brent Price  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT     Jeff Sommers  CALME    Executive Lead - Univsersity of Florida   Ed Coats  Corp. Tax    Core Team Member - UT, A&M, LSU and University of  Florida   Sally Beck  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT and OU   Carolyn Barrett  EBS       Howard Selzer  Enron Global E&P    Summary of Concerns and Discussion Points:  One program, or two:  Prior to campus recruiting in the fall 1999, an  announcement  was made that there would be one analyst program.\n",
      "Not much  materialized from that point to clarify what that meant or how that would be  managed.\n",
      "In fact, those of us involved heavily in the recruiting process saw  that the MSAP and the Commercial Anlayst programs were managed separately and  differently in terms of campus recruiting, rotations and orientation.\n",
      "We  feel uninformed and therefore are hampered in discussing the analyst program  on campus.\n",
      "SIngle start date:  The single start date of July 17 for analysts is  impractical and inflexible; a concern from our points of view for an  innovative company.\n",
      "The July start date does not consider December graduates  and is not necessarily practical for undergrads whose graduation dates are in  May.\n",
      "Lack of communication:   We are some of the most involved and committed  senior managers in the MSAP, and yet we have received little information or  communication about the program.\n",
      "We hear rumors of \"tracks\", but no facts  or details.\n",
      "Some of us had heard about the single July start date, and some  had not.\n",
      "Commercial focus too heavy:  Presentation materials, the attitudes of support  staff in the Associates/Analysts Program and interview processes are heavily  focused on commercial needs, without understanding support needs.\n",
      "Lack of input from biggest supporters:  Given the time and effort that many  of us put into the MSAP, we are concerned that we haven't been asked to join  with you in some of your plans for the program.\n",
      "We are concerned that  decisions (example:  the single start date) are being considered in a vacuum  without what could be some valuable input from some of us.\n",
      "MSAP has taken a step backward:  Previously, with a dedicated leadership team  and staff, the MSAP had made great strides in the consistency of our on  campus efforts, the quality of candidates, the acceptance rate of top  candidates and the pride of participants in the program.\n",
      "We feel that the  focus on the MSAP has diminished considerably over the last nine months, and  we are anxious to work with you to renew excitment for the program.\n",

      "While Greg and Jeff were certainly both with ECT in 1996 when we had an  earnings hit as a result of flash to actual variances, I am not sure that  either one was involved closely enough to appreciate the need for a strong  front to back focus to prevent these problems, and that includes holding  logistics accountable for their part in this.\n",

      "Doorstep reviews are by design a quick look at commercial activities and the  mid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale  businesses.\n",
      "(EBS and EES will be included in 2001.)\n",
      "The controls around  mid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test  - i.e.\n",
      "following the process and documentation around a series of  transactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash.\n",
      "Asking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of  explaining what we think happens.\n",
      "Doing a deal test tells us what does  happen.\n",
      "And it is when there are differences between the controls that we  believe to be in place and what actually happens, that we identify where  operational, and perhaps financial, risk is created.\n",
      "These reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which  Enron has contracted with Arthur Andersen.\n",
      "As such, they are purposely  designed to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than AA's reviews and to  produce less paperwork.\n",
      "It is both the quick assessment of control gaps and  potential operational risk, and the quick solutions to correct these, that  are valuable in these reviews.\n",
      "These reviews also look  for ways to leverage  success stories from one office to another in terms of best in class  practices or practical solutions to shared problems.\n",
      "Briefly, the doorstep  review process would follow this set of steps:   1)  Cross-functional doorstep review team arrives at subject office.\n",
      "This  is usually unannounced, but key personnel in the subject office may be  notified of the review a few days prior to the team's arrival to be certain  that key individuals in that office will be not be out of town.\n",
      "2)  Doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell  them about the parameters of the review and to ask their co-operation in  making information and personnel available to complete the review.\n",
      "3)  The review is conducted, including information sessions with key  commercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and  key control/operations personnel to understand the business processes.\n",
      "The  deal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process  and controls that were followed in the life of the transactions.\n",
      "4)  The doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of  the review, which includes both controls that are working well and those  which may not be working as designed.\n",
      "Potential action items are suggested.\n",
      "This information is reviewed with the head of the office, as they are usually  very interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support  their business.\n",
      "There are times when the head of an office will suggest an  additional point to be added to the list of action items, knowing that with  this focus he/she can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support  the growth of their business.\n",
      "The doorstep team lets the head of the office  know to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing  so.\n",
      "5)  Starting late in 2000, the findings from doorstep reviews would next be  reviewed with Ted Murphy and me.\n",
      "Ted's viewpoint would be from Risk Controls  and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view.\n",
      "Ted and I,  assisted by Cassandra Schultz and Shona Wilson, would work with appropriate  personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume  responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and  to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items.\n",
      "Then on a quarterly basis, Ted and I would meet with Rick Buy and Rick Causey  to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter,  doorstep findings that had been handled, updates on any outstanding doorstep  findings and plans for the next quarter.\n",
      "Through most of 2000, the doorstep  teams met with Rick and Rick within a few days of returning from each  doorstep review.\n",
      "This immediate feedback step was passed to Ted and me  sometime late in 2000.\n",
      "We did agree that we would meet with Rick and Rick  before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular  concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more  timely manner than quarterly.\n",
      "Steps 1 through 4 were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in  Germany.\n",
      "Shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors  in charge of the scrap metal business.\n",
      "Her impression was that they were not  concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the  integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were  discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with Enron's  practices.\n",
      "Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan, and I believe that Fernley  was involved in that session as well.\n",
      "At my suggestion, she also contacted  Joe Gold to inform him of her findings.\n",
      "I do not know what the timing was  for Joe to get back to Shona, relative to Rick Buy's e:mail message.\n",
      "Michael, I understand that you may have felt blind-sided by the e:mail from  Rick Buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business.\n",
      "And if that was the  case, I apologize for that.\n",
      "While Shona did debrief with Mike and Fernley, I  know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you.\n",
      "If you  would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when  they review businesses that are managed by EEL, we can certainly add that as  a clear step from this point going forward.\n",
      "The out of the ordinary step in  this doorstep review was Shona's call to Rick Buy and Rick Causey to alert  them to the doorstep team's concerns over irregular payment methods and the  level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing  directors.\n",
      "I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and  myself.\n",
      "Although we had changed the process at year end so that the  download after doorstep was to be with Ted and me, as Shona and I voice  mailed back and forth she thought that I had asked that she initiate a  meeting with Rick and Rick.\n",
      "This meeting should have been with Ted and me.\n",
      "In leaving a voice mail for the two Rick's about setting up a meeting, Shona  mentioned some concerns.\n",
      "Rick Buy is the one that called her back and asked  for more detail.\n",
      "She definitely covered both the teams findings and the  integration plan that was underway with Rick Buy.\n",
      "We don't, however, control  which points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react.\n",
      "To reiterate, the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the  heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews.\n",
      "The effort here is  to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to  offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire  Enron organization.\n",
      "The key is quick discovery and quick resolution.\n",
      "The  findings create a dialogue between the business units, RAC and Operations,  which I believe is healthy.\n",
      "We purposefully have chosen not to  \"over-wordsmith\" the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be  surfaced through these reviews.\n",
      "Frankly, I believe that these reviews can  reveal things that are sometimes missed in AA's reviews from a practical  perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk.\n",
      "I would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with  you.\n",
      "We certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as  valuable input for you in managing EEL's business.\n",
      "Mike Jordan and certain  members of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other  businesses outside EEL later in the year.\n",
      "We are certainly open to any  suggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process.\n",

      "Circuit Court of Appeals, DC Circuit, issued a ruling today on the EPA Section 126 Rule.\n",
      "(As brief background, the 126 Rule would have required compliance with more stringent summer-season NOx caps starting in May 2003 in several northeast and Midwest states)  The Order states:    \"It is Ordered that EPA's Section 126 Rule is remanded as to all cogenerators, but vacated only as to those cogenerators classified as electric generating units (\"EGUs\") under the rule that supply equal to or less than one third of their potential capacity or equal to or less than 25 MW to the grid for sale per year.\"\n",
      "Translation:  This part of the order appears to \"vacate\" or completely throw out the 126 rule for small cogen units (under 25 MW) or cogen units selling less than 1/3 into the grid.\n",
      "For all other cogenerators, the court remands the rule to EPA for re-working, consistent with some of the court's earlier objections about EPA's handling of cogens.\n",
      "Impact:  EPA will need to go back and formulate rules for cogens altogether, so there is currently no NOx compliance schedule in place for cogen units.\n",
      "EPA will need to start from scratch for smaller cogens.\n",
      "\"It is Further ordered that as of May 15, 2001, the date of this court's decision, the three-year compliance period for emissions limitations applicable to EGUs under the Section 126 Rule is tolled, pending EPA's resolution of the remand of EGU growth factors ordered by this court.\"\n",
      "Translation:  This more significant part of the order \"tolls\" -- or puts on hold -- compliance with the 126 Rule for ALL ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS (EGUs) until EPA resolves EGU growth factor issues that the court identified in its May 15, 2001 ruling.\n",

      "Pre September 11  We had already been operating under the assumption that our economy has been in a recession for a while.\n",
      "Although the technical definition of recession may not have been achieved, we can't see much difference between positive 0.2% and negative 0.1% economic growth.\n",
      "We also thought the trillion dollar plus loss in stock market wealth had to manifest itself into a general economic contraction.\n",
      "We had not expected to see the trends of growing lay offs and shrinking cash flows to turn around until the third quarter of 2002.\n",
      "Our perspectives have been more pessimistic than the general market up until September 11.\n",
      "We believe both expansions and contractions can feed off themselves.\n",
      "The current contraction seemed to validate this.\n",
      "We also believe it is usually significant events that provide the catalyst to turning these trends.\n",
      "Post September 11  The events of September 11 will certainly put us in a technical recession.\n",
      "Now though, we don't expect to see the cash flow contractions and lay offs draw themselves out for as long a period.\n",
      "The economic contraction will now be steeper, but with the bottom reached sooner.\n",
      "In crisis mode, Washington is being very proactive at providing stimulus to the economy.\n",
      "We don't think this would have been the case outside of a crisis.\n",
      "A significant event has provided us with the stimulus for renewed growth.\n",
      "We now believe light at the end of the tunnel may appear in the second quarter of 2002, a modest growth environment to appear in the third quarter of 2002 and possible robust growth by the end of next year.\n",
      "The hole we fall in will be deeper, but now we have much more of a helping hand from Washington.\n",
      "The Future  There's a lot we all have to be grateful for at this point in time.\n",
      "We've all benefited from a very long expansion period.\n",
      "We've lived during the most amazing time in all of human history.\n",

      "PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  Mike Peterson asked me to send you the following note, with attached order:  Attached is an Order signed yesterday and entered this morning by Judge Rosenthal on Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO and Preliminary Injunctive Relief (including a freeze of defendants' \"insider trading proceeds\") - i.e., the matter on which there was a hearing with attendant media hoopla last month.\n",
      "You probably recall that at the end of the hearing, Judge Rosenthal asked for briefing on a rather arcane legal point concerning whether or not the Court had authority to issue the requested preliminary relief, and the parties submitted briefs on this matter on December 15 and December 21.\n",
      "In the attached Order, Judge Rosenthal concludes that the Court does have the requisite authority, but the present record does not contain evidence warranting a freeze of any individual defendant's proceeds from the sale of Enron stock.\n",
      "You might take further comfort from two additional points in the Court's opinion: (a) at several places, the Court clearly indicates that any \"freeze\" or other such injunctive relief as to any defendant would have to be predicated on an individualized evidentiary showing as to that defendant; and (b) the Court indicates that plaintiffs would have to satisfy a very difficult \"tracing\" requirement to establish a right to a constructive trust or freeze (i.e., \"trace\" a specific asset or fund of money held by any defendant back to the profits of an improper insider trade).\n",
      "The aspects of the Court's opinion that arguably are favorable to the plaintiffs are (a) the discussion of \"an equitable accounting,\" wherein the Court suggests that the plaintiffs might be able to satisfy the requirements for an order that defendants account for profits earned by trading Enron securities between October 1998 and November 2001; and (b) providing an opportunity (through January 23) for plaintiffs to file a brief addressing whatever expedited discovery they believe they are entitled to as to the individual defendants, \"particularly as to .\n",

      "All decisions regarding those entities are being made by the administrator.\n",
      "Michael Brown, Fernley Dyson, John Sherriff are not in the building and to the best of my knowledge have resigned all directorships.\n",
      "Most of the remaining employees (300) are working for the administrator.\n",
      "There are, however, interests of Enron Corp which are housed in Enron House may not be getting the attention they deserve or , potentially more concerning, are being used or eyed by the locals for their benefit.\n",
      "Examples are : 1) the contractual assets in ECTRIC which include financial trades, weather derivatives, nordic energy, some crude and products trading.\n",
      "2) large in the money pumped storage trade which is in a US-based LLC - in the money by a net $50MM 3) Enron Direct is being offered for sale (JV with EES) 4) The TXU VPS contracts (currently under termination dispute) is being negotiated solely by administrators and their employees  Transactions are being terminated by counterparties, deals are being cut between the administrators and commercial for the dispostion of assets, and value is being eroded because no support staff will work without a reasonable expectation of being paid.\n",
      "Finally, the administrators have been here for several weeks and seem woefully prepared to take on the task at hand.\n",
      "We suggest that the Houston-based 'investor' (whether that is current managment or a trustee) ought to reconstitute some form of governance over its activities in Europe so that it can be assured of receiving maximum value for its assets here.\n",
      "Currently, we have little capability to cause the local staff to provide us with the information and access to make informed decisions.\n",

      "Let me use yesterday's closing price.\n",
      "The merger probability is derived from a two scenario test, merger closure or merger non closure (there is also a competing offer scenario in reality).\n",
      "Let's use a closing DYN price of $46.20 yesterday (note I had a typo), at the exchange ratio, (not taking into account timing and dividends), this yields a merged ENE price of $12.40 ($46.20 * .2685).\n",
      "ENE closed at $10.00 yesterday.\n",
      "Thus if the market thought there was complete certainty of merger, the prices would converge at $12.40.\n",
      "Now comes the artful part, the non merger ENE price.\n",
      "I included another tab (Merger) to sensitize this.\n",
      "Say we pick an ENE price with no merger of $4.00.\n",
      "Looking at a deterministic probability, one can look at the distance (difference) in dollars to calculate the probability.\n",
      "For instance:  ENE merged           12.40 ENE close 14-Nov   10.00 ENE no merger         4.00  Probability of merger = (1-((12.40-10.00) / (12.40 - 4.00))) or 71.4%.\n",
      "Said another way, there is a 71.4% chance of being worth $12.40 and a 28.6% chance of being worth $4.00, which yields a weighted price of $10.00  ($12.40 * 71.4%)+($4.00 * 28.6%).\n",

      "The losses now expected out of the Long Beach office are MUCH lower than initial estimates.\n",
      "If anyone would like to review, please call me directly.\n",
      "We are already well underway in establishing new transaction process' for both gas and power deals.\n",
      "Although we have already put in place and communicated these new procedures to each of the sales offices, we are putting together a \"sales package\" that will encompass each of the new procedures in detail, each of the new gas and power contracts and rules for use, and a new sales policy which will review in detail the responsibilities for each sales individual.\n",
      "This policy will require signatures from the sales folks in order for them to continue working for EES in a sales transaction role.\n",
      "We are also exploring an independent verification process whereby we would have someone from either Deal Capture or Deal Management actually contact the customer to confirm the transaction.\n",
      "The \"McDonald's Hamburger\" analogy is quite appropriate here!\n",
      "Just wanted to let everyone know what was already underway.\n",

      "Here's how I interpreted the BOD approvals:  The BOD approved an aggregate of $150MM, with $50MM of discretionary VaR, plus the new policy which doesn't recognise the concept of discretionary VaR.\n",
      "So here's what I did:  Effectively I allocated all the $50MM of discretionary such that Pug's \"Big Buckets\" are now as follows:  US Gas\t\t\t\t$100MM US Elec\t\t\t\t$100MM Europe Gas & Elec\t\t\t$35MM Global Products\t\t\t$20MM Financials\t\t\t\t$15MM Emerging Businesses\t\t$20MM  If you have a calculator handy you'll see that this aggregates to $149.164MM (assuming zero correlation).\n",
      "At Business Unit level the individual commodity limits are unchanged, and I have put limits over the Business Units themselves as follows:  Enron Americas\t\t\t\t$82MM EWS OOC (aka George Martingale)\t$3MM  EEL\t\t\t\t\t$34MM EGM\t\t\t\t\t$23MM EIM\t\t\t\t\t$8MM EBS\t\t\t\t\t$4MM PGE\t\t\t\t\t$4MM ETS\t\t\t\t\t$1MM  Again I used root-sum-of-squares, and remember the original commodity limits (by VaR, net open and mat gap) are still in place (e.g.\n",

      "Rod, Stan and Rick,  Pursuant to your request, I have visited PGE last week and had conversations with the respective PGE employees.\n",
      "Below are my conclusions and analysis.\n",
      "In Retrospect (Jan-01 - Sep-01)  Background During this period PGE has negotiated a Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) mechanism that limits PGE risks and rewards.\n",
      "According to this mechanism, PGE is responsible for only 10% of the costs in excess of $232.5 MM.\n",
      "Earlier in the year, PGE has accumulated the length for the 2001-2002 period that appreciated in value significantly as prices were increasing.\n",
      "Since liquidations on the hedges are included in the power costs, this value has offset the company's power costs and pushed the total cost of power in the deadband, where PGE wears 100% of risks and rewards.\n",
      "Earnings Impact As prices continued to decline against the long position, PGE incurred significant power costs from its hedge liquidations and moved through the deadband, where the Company wears 100% of the downside.\n",
      "Other items that impacted earning included: \t- reduced load during the period \t- reserves for CA receivables \t- losses in spec trading  For the remainder of the PCA, through the end of Sep-01, PGE is only responsible for 10% of the incurred power costs.\n",
      "Analysis In my opinion, the following factors have affected PGE's decision to maintain the length in a bearish market:  \t- bullish or not as bearish sentiment among traders \t- reliability issues: PGE has significant political and financial repercussions for being caught short in a blackout \t- psychological fears of tight power supplies and potential blackouts/brownouts, mainly because of recent situation in CA  Next 15 Months (Oct-01 - Dec-02)  PGE has agreed to implement a similar PCA mechanism for the next 15 months.\n",
      "Below are the highlights: \t - PGE is currently negotiating the base cost level with the PUC.\n",
      "This is a critical step to ensure that PGE's estimate of the 15-months baseline power costs, as agreed with \tthe PUC, is equal to or greater than the actual costs for the period (~$984 MM) - the new PCA provides for tighter bands (+/- $28 MM for 100% exposure) - transmission costs, resulting from load variations are not factored into the PCA mechanism - Given tighter bands, PGE will begin to place greater emphasis on the spec book - MTM earnings  Beyond 2002  PGE is naturally short beyond 2002 (load exceeds generation and hedges).\n",
      "PGE could begin discussions with the PUC on the structure of a new PCA mechanism to limit their risk and rewards; or move towards greater deregulation.\n",
      "There is a possibility that PGE will loose some of its industrial commercial load during this time period, with an obligation to take them back at a standard offer.\n",
      "In the meantime, the Company began purchasing power for the 2003-2004 time period to cover residential load.\n",
      "Recommendations/Action Steps  1.\n",
      "Design decision authority process for significant business decisions.\n",
      "In retrospect, it would be helpful to analyze the value of the long position against the cost of reliability and make a decision accordingly.\n",
      "Other examples: should PGE apply for a PCA mechanism past 2002, should PGE be purchasing power for 2003-2004.\n",
      "Also, participate regularly in the PGE Risk Management Committee meetings.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Continue to improve trading controls (missed a deal earlier in the year resulting in a $10 MM loss in the spec book).\n",
      "Significant improvements have been made since then.\n",

      "Rick - further to our discussion, here is the change Enron Americas are requesting in their limit structure:  Eliminate volumetric limits on net open position and maturity gap; Eliminate limits on individual commodities within the business unit; Replace with one limit, expressed in VaR, for the entire business unit, of $100MM.\n",
      "I am not uncomfortable with $100MM, given the opportunity set and the required returns from this activity.\n",
      "ETL at this level could be in the region of $340MM.\n",
      "I think the other things to consider in making the decision are as follows:  Does the VaR tell us sufficient about the risk ?\n",
      "I think it does since we have the ability to see components of it in some detail and it backtests well  Tail Risks  Generally we have the most data on tail risks for US gas and power and we are most confident about the EVaR and ETL measures for these commodities.\n",
      "Liquidity  This should be a key point in removing volumetric limits because they give us a concept of size.\n",
      "Our recent analysis has shown that our ability to unload risk in US natural gas certainly is high (50% reduction, 10 days) - but we need to continually revisit this analysis.\n",
      "Administration of Risk  Generally I think we are comfortable - deal capture is good since so many trades are picked up through EOL.\n",
      "Delegation of authority using VaR limits at desk level is strong   But since VaR is so dependent on MTM values and curves I would still recommend a review of:  curve validation results; ageing of confirmations outstanding (in and out); flash to actual differences (if any)  Compliance with Policy  The policy requires limits under the business unit by \"commodity groups\" in some combination of volumetric and VaR limits.\n",
      "We also must approve products/commodities for a business unit.\n",
      "One interpretation of this is to define the commodity \"group\" as the aggregate of gas, power, coal, crude, and approve those products, in which case the aggregate limit for the business unit is the commdity group limit also - so we can have one limit.\n",
      "Our concern about the Firm blowing up because everyone is short crude, for example, is covered by the fact that we can still see all the components of our aggregate risk to a single commodity, which is also capped by the concentration limits.\n",
      "The only question is from a governance standpoint, how you prevent yourself bumping up against those and having to explain it to the board.\n",
      "Another side of this argument is the \"10K analogy\" - if I put $100MM into my 10K via a mutual fund I am likely to want them to declare in which markets they invest it.\n",
      "To summarize, I think we could justify losing volumetric limits for this business.\n",
      "On the question of level of risk and commodity limits, I think we should talk it over with Greg / Ken.\n",

      "risk books, into risk applications which calculate VAR, provide credit exposures,  feed Infinity with daily cash flows and ultimately the DPR.\n",
      "Sally and Beth, along with IT, have initiated a project to improve and monitor the accuracy and efficiency of these daily interfaces.\n",
      "The scope includes a review of the processes which  impact the accuracy of  information, timing of interfaces, production performance issues, inventory of books and improved controls over changes to book attributes, and the officialization process.\n",
      "They have agreed to add a requirement to provide, on a daily basis, this reconciliation across all major risk applications.\n",
      "The projected  timeline to complete this project, including the reconciliation initiative, is 60 to 90 days.\n",
      "We will need to reassess the decision to combine these initiatives, if the GRMO timeline slips.\n",
      "This daily risk applications reconciliation will provide four key metrics not currently available:  1) the ability to track data \"accuracy\" in terms of the percentage of information which transferred and processed correctly, vs. just unique \"failures\".\n",
      "How complete is the data?\n",
      "2) the ability to validate the accuracy of exception reporting (are all failures included on the exception reports?)\n",
      "3) the ability to validate Infinity cash flows  4) Reconciliation of values (volumes, PRMA &PRML and cash flows), not # of books processed.\n",

      "We have been working with your IT people on security but this is a new practice for us that we are having great success in the energy companies.\n",
      "As we have worked with more companies on the finance side of businesses we have had to eliminate the IT terms so it makes a lot more sense to Risk Managers now.\n",
      "e-Risk Management starts with a way to manage the risks of e-commerce such that these risks are understood from the technologists to the board room and you can manage it.\n",
      "Since this is such a new and radically different concept I have found our literature confuses more often than it helps.\n",
      "It has some basic tenants that are straight forward that can be presented and understood but are not easy to write down.\n",
      "It is not a product.\n",
      "First, we are going to define risk as the potential reduction in assets from the threats of e-commerce.\n",
      "Now, you have more intangible assets than tangible assets so that we have mastered.\n",
      "So this discussion is on the asset management side and is a key concept to understand.\n",
      "Everything else is based on that.\n",
      "Often we get in an income vs. balance sheet discussion.\n",
      "In your case you have $11B in book value and $27B in market value so you have $16B in intangible assets.\n",
      "There are two things to do with these assets 1) protect them as you become e-commerce enabled and 2) figure out how to leverage and grow them with e-business.\n",
      "So this is where we start.\n",
      "On the protection side e-commerce threats will come two ways.\n",
      "Your largest threats are going to be on transactions, like trading, asset acquisition or payments.\n",
      "Other threats will come from vulnerabilities in your network.\n",
      "So this is both in trading, business strategy and Information technology.\n",
      "That is the e-Risk management side.\n",
      "On the growth side once we and you allocate these $16B of intangible assets to categories, strategies can be built to grow selected areas.\n",
      "Of course, fixed IT assets have a high need to be leveraged also.\n",
      "Approximately 25% of your IT budget is managing boxes ( fixed assets) that has no competitive value.\n",
      "That is what we are doing at Chevron.\n",
      "For protection you can throw an infinite amount of technology dollars at the e-commerce security requirement and not eliminate the risk (if you pin your technology people to the wall they will finally admit this).\n",
      "However, once you have e-Risk Management you can manage the costs of technology and risk to what we call \"The Most Favored Case\" investment.\n",
      "Companies have found this e-Risk concept should be completed before a security policy is developed because until you do understand the asset risk you don't know what to write a security policy to do.\n",
      "Let me know if you need more.\n",
      "Many energy companies, especially the utilities, have added e-Risk to Risk Management.\n",
      "Many recognize e-Risk as the biggest going forward.\n",
      "This is aimed at getting that elevated Risk Management concept under way.\n",
      "Normally we would like to come in for an introduction meeting ( 1 1/2 hours) to get the basic concepts covered and then talk about what our e-Risk Practice does.\n",

      "The new DASH, the template of which should be completed early next week, would be prepared earlier in the process that was typically the case in the past, would contain a RAC recommendation, and would then be used as the approval document for the appropriate committee (Transaction Review or Bankruptcy Management) to recommend or approve a transaction.\n",

      "Fill Order - If a product is set up as either Restricted Top of Stack or Top of Stack the trader now has the ability to automatically fill any order that is at the top of the stack.\n",
      "In order to fill a limit order that is at the top of the product's stack, which will appear in pink, the trader should right click anywhere on the stack window and choose \"Fill order\".\n",
      "The volume filled on an order will be that which is offered by the trader.\n",
      "In order to fill the complete volume of the order, the trader will need to adjust the volume in his stack.\n",
      "Floated Stack windows - If the stack is inactive on a product, the price and volume fields on the my products tab will continue to be blank.\n",
      "On the depth window and floated stack window of these products the trader's prices will be in gray and italics.\n",
      "Children of products that have inactive stacks will not be gray and italicised in the floated stack windows and will not see the calculated prices.\n",
      "No Auto Inactivate Stack - It is now possible to keep a product active even if the trader is not logged into Stack Manager.\n",
      "If the trader wishes to enable this functionality on the upper right corner of the product properties page the trader should choose \"No Auto Inactivate when Stack Manager is down\".\n",

      "The Customer Settlements group makes every effort to render accurate invoices on a timely basis.\n",
      "Although issued a day after their scheduled posting, the invoices are still being issued within the 5-business days.\n",
      "{I'd forgotten about Labor Day when I set up the schedule.}\n",
      "Transmission Customers will observe adjustments for an error on in May 2000 Settlement  Adjustment  invoices  that  were  issued  in  July.\n",
      "The total adjustment  amounted to $2,081,568.11 and was allocated across 2,261,753.08 MWh.\n",
      "Customers  may  validate  their  respective adjustments by computing their  ratio  shares  of  the  $2,081,568.11  using  2,261,753  MWh  as the denominator  in  their respective ratios of their May 2000 load.\n",
      "The reason the  denominator of the ratio share appears small is because the pay out of this  adjustment is to the Transmission Owners.\n",
      "In order not to assess the TO's  a  proportionate  share  of the $2,081,568.11, which would defeat the purpose  of  the  adjustment, their withdrawals have been excluded from the ratio share.\n",
      "Transmission Owners should observe a credit on their invoices based upon their respective megawatt-mile coefficients for the period.\n",
      "With  regard  to  the  November 1999 & December 1999 settlement adjustments that  were  scheduled  to  be issued on the 7th, the NYISO intends to issue those  invoices  next  week.\n",
      "The issuance dates will ensure that customers will have at least 5 business days to review the invoices prior to payments being due to the NYISO.\n",
      "If necessary, the NYISO will reschedule settlement dates  for these months should our reconciliations take longer to complete; however, we do not anticipate this at this time.\n",
      "In  addition,  I'd  like to take this opportunity to clarify a point that I made  in  a  TIE  posting  regarding  the  rebilling  of  the  August  25th settlements.\n",
      "The  initial  billing runs for August 25th were done without considering  ConEd's  sub-zonal  load.\n",
      "As a result, it appeared as though there  was no load in the ConEd sub-zones on the 25th and all DAM purchases and  bilateral transactions in those sub-zones were sold back to the market in  real  time  causing  the  Schedule  1 residual adjustment to be grossly inflated.\n",
      "The reason this occurred was due to what appears to have been a frame  relay  problem  between the NYISO & ConEd resulting in the NYISO not receiving a file from ConEd.\n",
      "By no means was my email notification of this event  to  imply that ConEd was not complying with the daily load provision process.\n",
      "This was merely a hardware/communications issue.\n",

      "This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the costs for adjustment  #1 are not allocated to those that received payment through the adjustment, which would defeat the purpose of the adjustment.\n",
      "Prior  to  October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the revenue   received  from  Schedule  1  charges,  which  were  comprised  of forecasted  uplift  & residual adjustments, and the costs actually incurred by  adjusting  subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly.\n",
      "In October 2000,  the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions that  allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred.\n",
      "In  order  to  allow  any  changes in uplift and residual adjustments to be settled  through the settlement adjustment process, the code implemented in October 2000 was used to report these costs to the market.\n",
      "This results in an  over-collection  which  is  being  returned  to  Customers  through  an adjustment  to  their  monthly  balances.\n",

      "In the September 4, 2001 Order, the Commission decided that the \"translated in-city price cap is to be fixed at an amount determined on the day of the first in-city capacity auction under UCAP methodology\" using data from the most recent 12-month period.\n",
      "On the basis of Operating Data received by the NYISO, the Capacity-weighted EFORd for all Generators subject to market power mitigation measures for the 2001-2002 Winter Capability Period Auction is 7.04%.\n",

      "Other Changes  ISOSu is the prefix for sales or purchases that occurred as a result of NYISO transactions during the supplemental process.\n",

      "PTID numbers to be used when identifying UCAP purchased through the NYISO auction have been assigned.\n",
      "The PTID numbers range from 1 to 38 and are related to auctions or the supplemental processes.\n",
      "For example, a participant who is selling UCAP that was previously purchased in the summer strip auction would enter PTID number 1 on the Offer form when selling into a subsequent ISO auction.\n",
      "A list of PTID numbers is now available on the instruction page of the auction Offer forms.\n",
      "Reminder  When identifying an ISO auction, please remember that you must think in terms of the procurement period for the first auction month when the transaction took place.\n",
      "For example, on May 15 (the auction for the upcoming months of June through October) 3MW were transacted for the months of June and August.\n",
      "The auction reference that you will use for both the June and August transactions are ISOMoJun.\n",
      "The same auction reference would be used if on May 15, the transactions were for August and September.\n",

      "Lets say that you are awarded 25 MW from the Strip Auction and later move (purchase or sell) 5 MW through a bilateral.\n",
      "Your entries on the form would show the 25 MW strip auction transaction on one line and your second line would show the 5 MW bilateral transaction.\n",

      "Approximately 10 of the NFL games were won by the underdogs this week.\n",
      "Many people missed the Pittsburgh/Tampa Bay game, also the Carolina/Washington game, Baltimore/Cleveland, New England/Indy game; Atlanta/New Orleans, Denver/San Diego and Green Bay/Minnesota game.\n",
      "Back on Thursday, Buffalo was only picked by one person over Jacksonville.\n",
      "In the college games, just about everyone missed the North Carolina/Clemson game, while the Wisconsin/Illinois and USC/Notre Dame games were missed by about half the people.\n",
      "Through all that, Larry Campbell is the current leader with only 7 wrong, while George Phillips is the only other person still in contention with 8 wrong.\n",
      "Larry picked the Giants tonight with 39 total pts, while George picked the Eagles with 32 total points.\n",
      "Therefore, if the Giants win, Larry will win outright, if the Eagles win and there is 36 or more total pts, then Larry will also win.\n",
      "George will win with a Philly victory and 35 or fewer total points scored.\n",
      "There were 31 entries this week, therefore the prize is $62.\n",
      "There is another Thursday night NFL game this week, therefore we will make this week's picks due Thursday afternoon.\n",
      "I did have a few requests for making each entry $3 this week, to increase the money you could win.\n",
      "Therefore, please email me back if you would like to see the entry fee at $3 instead of $2.\n",
      "If we get more than 20 people who would not mind a $1 increase in the entry fee for a bigger prize, then we will go with it.\n",
      "I do not want to go more than $3 for now.\n",
      "Therefore, if we can keep the 30-35 people each week, the prize will be closer to $100, instead of $60-70 dollars.\n",
      "This is not my idea to have some people give up more money, but just a suggestion I got from a few people.\n",
      "Below are the number of games missed by each person this week.\n",

      "The MC last week urged a rapid consideration of the interactions between BME and SCD and their related prices from the hot, high load days of July 24 and 25.\n",
      "To pursue this there is additional information needed from the ISO.\n",
      "Below is a preliminary list I compiled that would be useful in assessing the situation.\n",
      "Data should be provided for relevant hours i.e.\n",
      "those with high BME or RT prices or both.\n",
      "Particularly for those hours with binding reserve constraints in HA or RT.\n",
      "1 RT reserve levels in each hour (it is recognized that the value fluctuates but the the point is to get an idea of apporximately how short the ISO was of reserves, if at all)  2 Similar information should be obtained for our neighbors; PJM, NE and IMO.\n",
      "Also, could the ISO describe what the others do hour ahead to prepare for the next operating hour under circumstances such as we encountered those two days?\n",
      "NY has the unfortunate position of producing prices related to decisions for which it pays otherwise - what were our neighbors doing?\n",
      "3 An accounting, by hour, of reserves carried on exports out of NY  4 Identification of any non-ICAP based exports that may have been counted for reserve; this shouldn't happen as it puts non-ICAP providers in the position of being recalled...  5 BME reserve deficiencies by hour; were the reserve levels always met, albeit at extreme prices, or was the ISO unable to cover the requirements in advance?\n",
      "6 Based on Mike Calimano's report, there were \"a couple hundred Mws\" of operating units not seen by BME; this situation needs to be (1) confirmed and (2) explained and corrected  The following are sort of 2nd tier questions:  1 If the ISO was short of reserves in RT why weren't the EDRP resources, who were notified, not called into play to aid in curing the deficiency?\n",
      "There should have been no economic judgement call by operators (if the first two hours were at $500 that was likely cheaper than what BME was taking in if the BME prices applied to settlement under ECA B).\n",
      "BME made no judgement call when its prices spiked due to the 30 M NSR scarcity and took available imports.\n",
      "2 What would have been the System State(s) if the reserve margins had been held in RT (assuming ISO was short in RT)?\n",
      "Would this have forced a Major Emergency and subsequent voltage reductions, public appeals etc?\n",
      "Had this been done would have the EDRP Mws been activated?\n",
      "I would also like to offer the following as potential changes to be considered.\n",
      "They are based on the limited discussions that have taken place so far.\n",
      "1 Include exports that are being counted as reserve in BME as it evaluates its reserve position.\n",
      "Since BME is deciding which transactions will be scheduled, operators would need to indicate which transactions and how many Mws could be counted in RT as reserves.\n",
      "The implications for the solution algorithm are unclear - can BME recognize the additional reserves thus carried?\n",
      "Would it result in fewer imports and lower BME prices?\n",
      "What if the reserve requirements used as input to BME were manipulated downward for reserves on exports?\n",
      "What happens if BME did not schedule the export(s)?\n",
      "2 Subject to the ISO providing detailed RT reserve info, it seems that the reserves should be carried in RT and that SCD should not be allowed to dispatch with units that were not available to BME (thus resulting in the large price disparities).\n",
      "If the ISO had adequate reserves in RT, SCD should not be allowed to produce RT price reductions relative to what BME is doing.\n",
      "However, having said this, if there are no energy resources to maintain reserve levels AND the ISO needs to maintain its regulation room, the next thing to go is load.\n",
      "To my long understanding, we do not shed load to avoid shedding load (at least not to maintain reserves...)  Perhaps if BME has some adjustments and the missing Mws are accounted for, little needs to be done in RT.\n",
      "(This does not mean that SCD handles GTs correctly - that is still a commit problem it is incapable of resolving...)  3 At one point, we had approved use of BME prices to settle all HA transactions.\n",
      "This approach was scuttled by the ISO when they discovered that there were persistent, unidirectional price differences between the proxy busses and their connected in-NY zones.\n",
      "We then retreated to automating what is done under ECA B; substituting BME prices only under constrained ramp or ATC conditions.\n",
      "The ISO should review this again.\n",
      "Does the price difference remain, inviting gaming?\n",
      "If so, is there a way for the MMU to watch for or prevent inappropriate opportunistic behavior?\n",
      "A full, partial 3rd settlement would lessen the sting of HA prices that are out of synch with RT.\n",
      "4 The ISO should review the multipliers in the LP solution that insure that energy, then regulation and then the 3 types of reserve are maintained.\n",
      "They should be no more than required for a proper solution outcome.\n",
      "Prices at $65000 are not necessary and misleading (while mathematically correct...).\n",
      "Also, if we are to consider settling transactions at BME prices, such an outcome would result in considerable opposition...  5 Another non-controversial change would be to extend the DADRP participants to hour ahead evaluation.\n",
      "In the instant circumstance, it is likely that BME would have chosen some of those loads opposed to imports (there was no congestion so some of those western loads might have looked pretty good...).\n",
      "Since there is the issue that the DADRP is subsidized, I would propose that, if extended to BME, that the DA bids be used for BME evaluation.\n",
      "If nothing else look at it as sending money to companies in NYS.\n",

      "With respect to the September 13, 1999 letter from Richard and Oreane Garcia  concerning pipeline integrity  and noise issues, Transwestern Pipeline  Company offers the following response:  Pipeline Integrity.\n",
      "With the construction of the evaporation ponds over  Transwestern's right of way and pipline, Transwestern has closely monitored  the potential for  impacts for the pipeline.\n",
      "This includes a more frequent  inspection of the pipeline conditions underlying the ponds by taking  potentiometric readings to verify that  corrosion is not present.\n",
      "Transwestern has also installed rectifiers to assist in eleminating the  potential of pipeline corrosion.\n",
      "As a DOT requirement, Transwestern has  cathodically protected the entire pipeline system with an external pipeline  coating to further ensure the integrity of the pipeline underlying the  evaporation ponds.\n",
      "The pipline safety  measures implemented by Transwestern  are designed to not only identify corrosion iimpacts to the pipeline system  at   the inception of detrimental impacts as a result of corrosion, but also  allow for long term stability and integrity  by conducting state of the art  monitoring and detection.\n",
      "Noise Issue.\n",
      "In the initial environmental assessment and study, Transwestern  conducted baseline surveys of the area to determine existing noise levels.\n",
      "This study was completed to assist Transwestern in the mitigation measures  which will be implemented after construction of the Gallup Compresso  Station.\n",
      "Pending completion of the facility, Transwestern will conduct post  noise studys to determine whether facility noise levels have increased above  those levels mandated by FERC.\n",
      "In the event of operational noise levels  exceeding the FERC regulatory level of 55 ldn, Transwestern is committed to  performing any and all  mitigation measures necessary to ensure that the post  noise level of the facility will not be above the level mandated by FERC.\n",
      "Decrepancy of trailer park residents.\n",
      "In the letter by Mr. Garcia, it was  stated that Transwestern's assessment of the number of residences in the  adjacent trailer park  was not 18 as had been stated in our original study,  but \"more like 35 trailers\".\n",
      "The number of mobile home residences currrently  in the trailer park may in fact be closer to 35.\n",
      "Transwestern's trailer park  residence count was taken in the winter of the year when the fluctuating job  market is normally down and the number of residences in the park was low.\n",
      "The transient nature of mobile home residences and the fluctuating job  economy of the area is probably a direct reflection of the up and down nature  of the residences.\n",
      "It should also be noted that during the time that the  trailer park count was made, the owner of the trailer park who is also the  operator of the evaporation ponds was experiencing major difficulties in the  operation of the  ponds and raw sewage  had overflowed the pond embankments  and  had resulted in the raw sewage ponding in the yards of many of the  trailer park residents.\n",
      "It was actually noted that many of the spaces  normally occupied by mobile homes had been vacated.\n",
      "This unsanitary  condition was also identified by the New Mexico Environment Department.\n",
      "The  NMED had implemented enforcement actions against the trailer park owner.\n",

      "I have spoken to Arnold  Eisenstein about what we can do with the strict 25 ppmvd requriement for NOx  and CO and he has said that we can hold to the 25 ppm value by doing some  major gas recycling.\n",
      "This is a fuel waste and costly.\n",
      "Anyway, depending  upon how long this issue delays the issuance of the permit will undoubtably  determine whether we give in to the 25 ppmvd or hold out for 40 ppmvd.\n",
      "Id  like your comments asap.\n",
      "1.\n",
      "The responsible official name change to  Danny Pribble.\n",
      "2..\n",
      "The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to  25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour average, except during periods of  startup   and shutdown.\n",
      "At 60F and above the GE data indicates that these  rates are achievable under all operating conditions.\n",
      "However, GE   data  indicates that NOx and CO may be as high as 40 ppmv during low-load  conditions of 60%and lower.\n",
      "The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of  the time with reduced load operations (64% load) occurring  no more than 20%  of the time.\n",
      "The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in  the application in units of lb.hr and ton/yr.\n",
      "These values were accepted by  the EPA for the netting analysis, and  took were taken into account by the  EPA (See EPA Statement  of Basis document).\n",
      "Because the permit conditions  hold us to ppmvd values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is    concerned that under low load conditions of less than 60%, the emissions of  NOx and CO would be 40 ppmvd.\n",
      "Transwestern is  requesting that  a provision  be made in the permit conditions that  emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40  ppmvd during the 20 % of  the time that the turbines operating conditions is  less than or equal to 60%.\n",

      "Transwestern has  received approval from the EPA for other custom  fuel monitoring schedules to  use  \"GPA Standard 2377\" (length of stain tube) or gas chromatography as the  proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the natural gas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transwestern Pipeline Company  Transwestern has run into some problems with the air permit conditions for  the Redrock Expansion.\n",
      "For the state permits, the ADEQ wants to abitrarily  set a 10% safety factor to the emissions levels which approach PSD.\n",
      "This  means that they have written into the draft permit a reduction in the  allowable hours of operation for  the generator from 8760 to 7800.\n",
      "This  generator is the facility's prime source of power and therefore, needs to be  operated for 8760 hours.\n",
      "Transwestern will challenge the agency's authority  to apply a 10%safety factor.\n",
      "For the Indain lands permits, the EPA has written a permit condition of 25  ppmvd for NOx and CO under all operating conditions.\n",
      "Manufacturerers  guarantees only apply at 25 ppmvd at loads above 65% and at 0F.\n",
      "It appears  that Transwestern may have convenienced the EPA to back away from permit  limits in ppmvd and include as permit conditons lb/hr and ton/yr emissions  limits that Transwestern originally placed into its applications.\n",

A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from  North Dakota State University, (Energy and Environmental Research Center) who  claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered  difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due  to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and  channels present which direct  the PCB containing liquids present at the  site).\n",

      "INTERNAL COMMUNICATION REGARDING DELAYS  IN RETAIL COMPETITION IN TEXAS October 29, 2001  The main purpose of this memo is to inform EPMI and EES commercial teams regarding the implementation status of retail competition Texas, particularly in non-ERCOT regions, which  include parts of the areas served by the following utilities:  ?\n",
      "Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO) and West Texas Utilities Company (WTU) - both in the SPP region ?\n",
      "Entergy Gulf States (EGSI) - in the Energy-SERC region  As most of you probably have heard, the Texas Utility Commission has been examining, in the last few weeks, the readiness to implement retail competition in those areas.\n",
      "The Public Utility Commission of Texas (Staff) has filed petitions seeking a determination of whether market institutions are ready for retail competition in above areas, to start January 01, 2002.\n",
      "There is a concern among the Commission and many other participants that non-ERCOT-Texas regions are not ready for competition.\n",
      "This concern has two major causes: -\tLack of a vibrant, efficient wholesale market in those regions, where newly established REPs could have full access to others suppliers, on a non-discriminatory basis -\t      Lack of success in the retail pilot programs developed in 2001 - no alternative suppliers and no customer shifting at all; a recent hearing has confirmed most REPs absolute lack of interest in those regions - at least for the time being  SPP  Last Week, the Public Utility Commission decided to delay competition in SPP Texas.\n",
      "Or, more accurately, \"to delay customer choice\", in the Commission preferred language.\n",
      "Enron, who was requested to file a testimony, opposed to any delays, under the argument that SPP is not a \"perfect market\", but REPs could trade in this market as other marketers do.\n",
      "No final dates have been established yet.\n",
      "However, one estimates that the delay may vary from 12 to 18 months.\n",
      "The Commission has established some clear actions and milestones before retail competition is implemented: -\tSupport SPP to begin wholesale market operations, which involves refinements and upgrades in a few of existing systems, such as settlement; -\t      Reform in SPP Tariffs and implementation of a market based congestion management; -\t      Continue the pilot, attract new competitors and open the market.\n",
      "As part of this effort, the Commission created a Southwest Power Pool Market Readiness Implementation Project (Docket # 24869) to develop the necessary steps to transition to full competition, identify milestones, monitor progress and report to the Commission on a regular basis.\n",
      "Enron will be supporting this effort.\n",
      "SERC  SERC regions bear resemblance with SPP, in terms of Commission's intent to delay competition.\n",
      "The most important difference is that the incumbent utility, EGSI, an Entergy subsidiary, has strongly supported timely implementation.\n",
      "The Commission fears that Entergy will benefit from its \"monopolistic\"  position in the region, in the absence of other REPs.  No final decisions have been made yet.\n",
      "Entergy Gulf States, in conjunction with the Commission Staff and other interested parties have gone through a settlement process, whereby retail competition will be delayed until September 15, 2002.\n",
      "The subject is still being examined by the Commission and no final decisions have been made.\n",
      "However, we expect the Commission to approve the Settlement Agreement, therefore delaying competition until September 15, 2002.\n",
      "ERCOT  All the discussion about delays in competition focuses on non-ERCOT Texas only.\n",
      "There are rumors and ongoing discussions about delaying competition in ERCOT-Texas, which is scheduled to take place on  January 01, 2002.\n",
      "For example, Nancy Hetrich from Enron, will be attending the Legislative Oversight Committee on Friday, November 02.\n",
      "She will be appearing in her capacity of Chair of RMS Sub-Committee.\n",
      "Contrary to non-ERCOT, there is a strong support from  most industry participants to have retail competition on time.\n",
      "Besides, the results from the pilots were successful and ERCOT is supposed to provide vibrant wholesale competition.\n",
      "Therefore, unlike SPP and Entergy, there should be no material reasons or fears to delay retail competition in ERCOT-Texas.\n",
      "We will keep you apprised as things evolve.\n",

      "This measure may go away soon or measures be made for increased x-ray, etc.\n",

      "After giving this trade situation WAY too much  thought, I have arrived at the following conclusions (giving  examples along the way so blockheads like DeFoggi can  understand the concepts).\n",
      "1.)\n",
      "One suggestion is to have the online trading  system  allow first come, first serve between specified  hours/days as allotted by the website.\n",
      "Unfortunately, the  reality is that this won't work because there are available  free agents on MY team and the only way to add/drop is that I  become notified anyway and go in and manually do the  transaction and waive the fee.\n",
      "2.)\n",
      "Power ratings so that the low man on the totem  pole gets a chance for first pick.\n",
      "Okay, so a  trader makes a  bad trade, loses money, gets fired, and then  gets the same job trading elsewhere for more money.\n",
      "A loser is a  loser and should be acknowledged as such (see Feeley).\n",
      "Those  are the breaks in this game.\n",
      "Besides, too time consuming  for me to go through the numbers.\n",
      "3.)\n",
      "Free market... first come, first served,  anytime, anywhere.\n",
      "This is a good concept in that those  that dedicate the time to watching, studying, and anticipating an opportunity  are allowed to seize the moment and get paid.\n",
      "And they should  because it is just like a small business, you get out of it  what you put into it.\n",
      "Time is money.\n",
      "However, you can't do  add/drops once your lineup is set and you should only be able to apply  trades to the upcoming week anyways.\n",
      "4.)\n",
      "Calling two fellow team owners to  validate your trade.\n",
      "Really, would you trust Gibby in this situation?\n",
      "I can hear  it now, \"Oh yeah, dude, I was drinking a soder pop when he  called but he neva said anything about picking up that QB.\"\n",
      "So, I have reached what I call a fair and amicable  solution to all of your f*cked up problems.\n",
      "First, the core of someone's team is going to  decide the results week in and week out.\n",
      "I've been in this long  enough to know that pickups (especially in a big league) are rarely  gonna make that big of a difference in the outcome of a  season.\n",
      "Past examples  include WR Thrash who had a spectacular  game against Seattle only to turn around and have a dismal game against  the lowly Cowboys.\n",
      "There was $15 given to the  pot.\n",
      "What I am getting at is that I think trading is way overrated and only  serves to build the pot for the team that drafted  the strongest in the beginning anyways.\n",
      "Second, online access allows a level playing  field.\n",
      "I agree with this and it should be implemented because it is  also time stamped so  there is no question as to who was first in a  selection.\n",
      "If an owner is going to stoop so low as to change the  clock on their computer to try and get an earlier time stamp, then there  are bigger mental problems down the road and the money you make off  the win should be applied accordingly.\n",
      "Third, my time is just as important and so is a \"transaction\" period.\n",
      "For example, this weekend is Octoberfest weekend in Fredericksburg.\n",
      "If you think I am going to hang around and stay sober so I can meet  your demands and implement your requests, you are sorely mistaken.\n",
      "I fully expect to start drinking myself into oblivion Friday evening  and  don't expect to come out of my coma until sometime Sunday  evening so your changes/requests/questions need to be done by Friday  afternoon.\n",
      "SO, here is what I suggest:   1.)\n",
      "to make an add/drop (trade) transaction, click on the \"Owners\"  tab on the league homepage (found up top next to Live Chat), page down to the bottom of the page and send a broadcast  email to ALL team members announcing your intentions.\n",
      "I will implement  the trade(s) on the Tuesday following the Monday night game.\n",
      "The transaction  deadline is Friday 5:00 PM for the weekend games.\n",
      "If I receive the email timestamped before  then, I will make the trade for the upcoming weekend.\n",
      "IF there is a Thursday night  game, Thursday 5:00 PM is the deadline for THE WEEKEND.\n",
      "At any time after the deadline if a transaction is submitted, it will apply to the following  weekend.\n",
      "Also, there will be NO limit on the amount of transactions, feel free to contribute  as much as you wish.\n",
      "2.)\n",
      "regarding current requested trades for the past  weekend: for this week only, send ME an email with your request.\n",
      "I will  take one trade per team this week only.\n",
      "If two teams want the same free agent,  whoever guesses closes to where the Nasdaq composite closes Wednesday, October 3rd  wins.\n",
      "The loser will be notified as such.\n",
      "So, BE SURE TO INCLUDE YOUR GUESS.\n",
      "This should provide everyone easy online access to making trades.\n",
      "All you  have  to do is make sure the free agent is indeed free, that nobody has already  sent you an email picking him up, and shoot a broadcast out to the owners  proclaiming  him as yours.\n",
      "Simple.\n",
      "So, any questions or concerns can be sent back to discuss.\n",
      "I will shoot  down all of them.\n",
      "I am going to lunch.\n",
      "I eagerly await the opportunity to tell you  why your plan won't work.\n",

      "Christina had passed along to Liz the various points I made at  the meeting last week, so Liz was prepared to address our primary  concerns.\n",
      "She made the following points:                    (1)    She has talked with several different people at various  levels of authority in Calpine's trading area, and insists that Calpine treats  the power grids as \"completely different\" regions, strategies for which are not  shared internally among those regions.\n",
      "(2)    She asserts that \"how we do it at Calpine is totally  different from Enron,\" since Calpine is \"trading around a portfolio of assets  that we own.\"\n",
      "She asserted that Enron, not owning power generation assets,  trades differently.\n",
      "When I replied that Enron does have power generation  assets, she acknowledged the fact but insisted that Enron's trading style is  vastly different due to the difference in emphasis vis a vis the power  generation assets.\n",
      "(3)    Liz claims that Miller works almost exclusively in  \"Urcot\" (sp??)\n",
      "in Texas, with some participation in Entergy in Louisiana.\n",
      "According to Liz, Calpine's strategies concerning these specific regions is  divorced from and not related in any way with any trading Calpine does in the  East or West.\n",
      "(4)    Liz is of the opinion that Miller \"is not senior enough  that we would be looking for what he knows.\"\n",
      "He has no role whatsoever in  discussing or formulating strategy for trading.\n",
      "Miller, she insists, is on  the receiving end only.\n",
      "He takes orders, dispatching and scheduling  solely in response to orders he receives from others.\n",
      "(5)    Liz acknowledges that, were Miller in a more senior,  responsible position, she would have the same concerns we are expressing were  the tables turned.\n",
      "Miller is \"so slotted,\" however, that she believes that  he is not in a position to use any Enron trade secret that he might possess  (though she and Miller's attorneys expressed doubt that he could retain any  critical information, that the most critical information changes on a day-to-day  basis).\n",
      "We  ended the conversation with the following  understandings:           (1)    Liz  will explore whether Calpine could put Miller in a non-trading function for a  period of two months or so.\n",

      "The elusive Liz Miller failed to attend, having been called at the  last minute into an all-day meeting.\n",
      "We have tentatively agreed that we  will meet next week.\n",

      "Doug Miller claims that there are three power grids that  are unrelated, that he worked only in the East for ENA and works only in Texas  for Calpine.\n",
      "Thus, he claims that his duties and activities do not overlap  in any way with those he performed for ENA.\n",

      "Calpine did not know of Miller's non-compete at the time  Miller was hired because he believed it had expired.\n",
      "He brought it to  Calpine's attention immediately upon being contacted by ENA.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "Christina argued, as she did in the answer and  counterclaim, that the non-compete agreement was fatally overbroad, as Miller  never had any duties involving the majority of the activities from which the  non-compete purports to bar him.\n",
      "In response, I told her the following:            1.\n",
      "We do not accept Miller's assertion that simply working in  another region will sufficiently insulate our trade secrets, since strategies  may not be confined to a single region.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "I pointed out to her that Miller's contract very clearly  states that the non-compete extends three months after employment even if the  contract term has expired.\n",
      "I also pointed out that he was reminded of his  non-compete orally several times by ENA personnel upon his  resignation.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "I explained that the non-compete had been enforced on many  occasions and that it was carefully crafted with an eye to protecting the many  trade secrets to which Miller may have had access.\n",
      "I argued that  strategies concerning one aspect of ENA's business might impact many other areas  and that, as such, the non-compete was not overly broad.\n",
      "[She asked what  trade secrets we were trying to protect!!\n",
      "I, of course, declined to  answer.]\n",
      "Despite the fact that I believe that these facts are clearly  stated in our petition, she confessed to not having viewed the situation from  the \"trade secret perspective.\"\n",

      "While most papermakers generally don't refine hardw= oods and softwoods with the same equipment, many smaller European mills are=  unable to afford the capital investment of a second refiner and accordingl= y do use a single refiner for all grades.\n",

      "Since hardwoods cannot withstand the rigorous refining req= uired for softwoods without losing their papermaking characteristics (opaci= ty, etc.\n",

      "CAEM PREDICTIONS IN 2002  What does Enron?s collapse mean?\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Markets work.\n",
      "Markets quickly punish mistakes.\n",
      "Little slack is given for past accomplishments.\n",
      "Markets are ruthlessly impersonal.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "No likely short term impact on consumers, other traders will fill the space left by Enron.\n",

      "Testimonial to benefits of markets.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "May have significant impact on public policy advocacy.\n",
      "Not obvious who picks up the slack.\n",
      "Enron could be counted on to be there, or so it appeared.\n",
      "No more free riders, we will all have to dig deeper and work harder.\n",
      "Consumers may be mid to long term losers if movement toward competition collapses, which it might do if states stretch out the transition period to competition.\n",
      "4.\n",
      "Enron?s collapse was not caused by deregulation.\n",
      "Viewed thoughtfully, it should not have any effect on deregulation movement.\n",
      "Does not stand for proposition that deregulation is not the right policy.\n",
      "5.\n",
      "Look for more regulation and oversight of energy transactions, accounting and business practices.\n",
      "A strange legacy for Enron, but a reality.\n",
      "6.\n",
      "As a practical matter, it is another setback for restructuring.\n",
      "But not as bad as portrayed by media ?\n",
      "Enron was the 600 pound gorilla that angered friends of competition almost as much as foes, thus making them less willing to step forward.\n",
      "Will feed growing skepticism many have about restructuring.\n",
      "7.\n",
      "Enron?s global reach into wholesale and retail markets meant that its policy positions were sometimes blurred (pro-wholesale?\n",
      "pro energy services?)\n",

      "8.\n",
      "Still, we have lost a champion.\n",
      "CAEM will miss their culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations, which led to the unbundling of the classic power contract (or paper or water, etc) into its constituent parts and offered customers choices on each one.\n",

      "To date, the Bush Administration has stayed on the sidelines ?\n",
      "except making the right noises here and there ?\n",
      "of making energy markets more competitive.\n",
      "This will need to change, beginning with more funds and staff devoted to helping the states on the retail side and supporting FERC in their efforts on the wholesale side.\n",

      "Tim Coffing has significantly improved this process; however, it is my understanding that we do not have, even at this time, a 100% accurate picture of historic usage, much less precise forecasts.\n",

      "Legislative Weekly                             November 7, 2001                            Issue 44, Volume 3                       A weekly publication from the            California Manufacturers & Technology Association      detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento  CMTA ADVOCATES FOR EQUIPMENT SALES TAX EXEMPTION  CMTA President Jack Stewart and member company Baxter Healthcare Corporation will testify on November 8 before the Assembly Committee on Jobs, Economic Development and the Economy and explain why an equipment sales tax exemption is needed by manufacturers and how its enactment would stimulate job growth in California.\n",
      "Chairwoman Sarah Reyes (D-Fresno) conducted a similar hearing last month in Silicon Valley at which this proposal was offered by high tech representatives.\n",
      "As a result, she invited CMTA to speak on this proposal further and to more fully describe how the sales tax exemption would help get California's economy back to health.\n",
      "CMTA believes that manufacturing and technology strength is essential to a strong California economy.\n",
      "Historically, our state has been a world leader in these industries which include electronics, biotechnology, aerospace, and the production of goods of every description.\n",
      "A strong manufacturing base brings high paying jobs and produces an enormous positive ripple effect in the state's economy.\n",
      "In order to stay in business, manufacturing companies must make enormous investments in capital equipment on a continuing basis.\n",
      "California taxes the purchases of manufacturing equipment while 46 states do not.\n",
      "Many of the 46 also provide tax credits to entice manufacturing expansion to their states.\n",
      "While existing MIC (California's Manufacturers Investment Tax Credit) law provides some companies a partial offset against sales tax liability, California's tax burden in this regard is one of the worst four in the country and much heavier than that of any other industrial state.\n",
      "Such an exemption would greatly enhance California's attractiveness as a choice for building a new facility or expanding an existing site.\n",
      "It would bring a direct and immediate incentive for expansion to all companies in all parts of the state in the manufacturing sector.\n",
      "CMTA will also give testimony on its proposed moratorium on regulatory fees and its measure to reduce electricity rates and provide customer choice in energy.\n",
      "ENERGY POLICIES REVISITED  As the energy crisis wanes, many of the actions taken in the last year are being revisited.\n",
      "Here's a sampling of what was done, why policy-makers are taking a second-look, and what may result:     * In January ABX1 1 (Keeley D-Boulder Creek) directed DWR to purchase      electricity, and DWR signed long term contracts at the height of      the crisis.\n",
      "High fixed prices and reliance on natural gas-fired      generation have caused consumers, environmentalists and the CPUC to      demand renegotiation.\n",
      "Contract modification could lower prices and      make more room for direct access contracts between customers and      suppliers.\n",
      "* ABX1 1 also prescribed a financing mechanism that upon second-look      the legislature wants modified by SBX2 18 (Burton D-San Francisco),      which uncouples payment for DWR contracts from payment of bonds.\n",
      "Citing a preference for SBX2 18 and renegotiation of DWR contracts,      the CPUC refused to approve a rate agreement so that bonds can be      issued.\n",
      "The Governor promises to veto SBX2 18, but has started      reviewing DWR contracts.\n",
      "* The Power Authority was created to ensure a 15% reserve margin in      electricity supplies.\n",
      "This spring it issued an RFP for supply, but      was informed recently by DWR that no additional long term supply is      required.\n",
      "Assemblyman Keeley will hold a hearing this month to      review the mission and activities of the Power Authority.\n",
      "* Last year the legislature passed a bill requiring all generators      sited under expedited 4 month licensing to switch from simple cycle      to cleaner combined-cycle within 3 years.\n",
      "On November 5th, under      the Governor's emergency powers, the CEC removed this requirement,      allowing the Power Authority to fulfill it's 15% margin with      dirtier plants for an indefinite term.\n",
      "Environmentalists claim that      this means dirtier plants for 30 years.\n",
      "* As the energy crisis became headline news, the ISO 27 member      stakeholder board came under attack as an ineffective,      generator-driven body.\n",
      "Replaced this year with a 5 member board      appointed by the Governor, the new ISO and DWR are now under attack      for sharing information and manipulating the wholesale market in      violation of federal law.\n",
      "* In June the CPUC ordered the largest rate increase in history.\n",
      "Since wholesale prices declined this summer, PG&E and SCE are      collecting more revenues than needed to cover current utility and      DWR costs.\n",
      "If this trend continues, rates may be adjusted      downward, or revenues may be allocated to historical costs, such as      utility and DWR back debt.\n",
      "* In September both PG&E and SCE submitted plans for payment of back      debt.\n",
      "PG&E is waiting for bankruptcy court approval of the asset      transfer to its holding company, and SCE is fighting for it's rate      freeze deal on appeal from federal district court.\n",
      "Legislators may      review the plans upon their return in January.\n",
      "A LOOK BACK AT THE INTERRUPTIBLE PROGRAM  It was almost a year ago that blackouts plagued California, and businesses that operated under interruptible contracts felt the squeeze of repeated curtailments.\n",
      "Dire predictions that the Summer of 2001 would be fraught with blackouts never came to pass, and a year later, the State continues to evaluate its energy infrastructure, supply and demand.\n",
      "Still at issue is whether or not those businesses that did not opt-out of interruptible programs will be required to repay the fines and penalties that accrued between October 2000 and January 25, 2001.\n",
      "Numerous requests to curtail, the threat of hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines and penalties, and suspension of the opt-out window in November 2000, led to demands by the business community for the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to act to remedy the situation.\n",
      "As a result, in January the CPUC suspended fines and penalties for failure to curtail under interruptible contracts and the programs temporarily were placed on hold.\n",
      "In April, the CPUC issued Rulemaking 00-10-002 which, among other things, allowed businesses to opt-out or readjust their firm service level effective November 1, 2000 if they repaid the discounts received from November 1, 2000 through April 25, 2001.\n",
      "These customers were not required to pay fines or penalties that accrued between those dates, however, they were prohibited from participating in any load reduction program that pays per kW for the remainder of 2001.\n",
      "Customers also were allowed to opt-out or to adjust their firm service level effective the beginning of the first billing period after approval of this rulemaking and upon notification by the utility.\n",
      "These customers were allowed to retain the rate discount for interruptible service through the date of any change in schedule or firm service level, but were required to pay any fines or penalties assessed for failure to interrupt during the period that fines and penalties were not suspended.\n",
      "The CPUC has wrestled with how to address the substantial fines and penalties assessed on businesses, and yet still preserve the program such that businesses would comply when called upon in the future.\n",
      "No CPUC solution would have made whole all businesses that participated in the program, and as expected, the CPUC decision affected each business differently.\n",
      "It is rumored that the CPUC will revisit the fines and penalties provisions to see how businesses that substantially curtailed, but were required to repay the full discount were impacted, however, a specific hearing date has not yet been set.\n",
      "Stay tuned for further developments.\n",
      "SLOWING ECONOMY HAMMERS BAY AREA WORKERS Technology Sector Drives Job Losses  According to a just released report by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the economic downturn has resulted in 30,000 lost Bay Area jobs in just the last five months.\n",
      "The breadth of the slowdown in the information technology (IT) sector has seriously begun to drag down employment in other sectors.\n",
      "The Bay Area relies on high-tech for 32 percent of its wages and 11 percent of its jobs.\n",
      "Business investment in IT products and software has slowed substantially this year, dampened by uncertainty in the national economy, dot-com and telecommunications crash, and over investment by business in IT products.\n",
      "The abrupt slowdown in business investment in IT has had a noticeable impact on orders, shipments, and production among technology firms, resulting in declines in output and employment in these sectors, according to the report.\n",
      "Softening markets for new office and industrial space have also dampened growth in construction employment this year.\n",
      "Employment among providers of shipping, trucking, and warehousing services also fell in recent months, as firms scaled back in response to slowing demand.\n",
      "BILL PROHIBITING \"ENGLISH-ONLY\" RULE MAY HINDER WORKPLACE SAFETY  The California Manufacturers & Technology Association (CMTA) opposed AB 800, a bill authored by Assemblyman Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) and signed by Governor Davis.\n",
      "The bill makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to limit or prohibit the use of non-English language in the workplace unless justified by an overriding business necessity.\n",
      "The Fair Employment and Housing Act already prohibits an \"English-only\" rule with one exception.\n",
      "An employer can require that employees speak only in English at certain times if the employer can show that the rule is justified by business necessity, and has effectively notified its employees of the circumstances and the time when speaking only in English is required, and the employees have been made aware of the consequences of violating the rule.\n",
      "AB 800 not only provides the same protections; it goes into greater detail that is difficult for an employer to follow and it creates a trap for the unwary employer.\n",
      "An employer may be sued if any step outlined in the bill is not followed exactly and could face both compensatory and punitive damages, plus a $5000 per worker statutory damage award.\n",
      "No empirical evidence was presented indicating that current law was ineffective or that multiple monetary penalties were needed to deter employers from violating this provision of the law.\n",
      "The bill may prove harmful to employees if it turns out that injuries or fatalities in the workplace begin occurring because safety and health rules are not being clearly communicated and understood by all employees and reinforced in a common language.\n",
      "CMTA is also concerned that the bill may encourage more discrimination and harassment complaints by employees who believe they are the subjects of non-English conversations that could severely undermine employee moral.\n",
      "AB 800 becomes law on January 1, 2002.\n",
      "Employers who have \"English-only\" rules should review their rules to make sure that they are not in conflict with the bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "On October 29, 2001, the commission issues an order instituting a rulemaking to establish ratemaking mechanisms to enable SCE, PG&E and SDG&E to resume purchasing electric energy, capacity ,ancillary services and related hedging instrument to full their obligation to serve their customers once DWR's authority to purchase on their behalf ends (December 31, 2001).\n",
      "At that point, the UDCs, not DWR, will have to pick up anything not covered by retained generation and the DWR contracts.\n",
      "The Commission will also address proposals on how renewable resources should be included in the mix of generation serving the state.\n",
      "The OIR will have a significant impact on procurement practices in the state on a going forward basis.\n",
      "The ruling states that if you are interested in being on the service list for this proceeding, a letter must be sent to the docket office stating that fact within 15 days (by next Monday).\n",
      "Bottom line is do you want me to continue to monitor (and perhaps get active) in this proceeding.\n",
      "Please let me know by the end of the week so that I can send in the required letter.\n",

      "Enron Receives Dynegy $1.5B Cash Infusion Tues. >DYN ENE By Christina Cheddar    11/14/2001  Dow Jones News Service  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)    NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) provided Enron Corp. (ENE) Tuesday with the $1.5 billion cash infusion envisioned in the companies' merger agreement, a Dynegy spokeswoman said.\n",
      "Dynegy received preferred stock and other rights in an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipeline in return for its investment.\n",
      "The cash infusion, which was made with the assistance of Dynegy's largest shareholder, ChevronTexaco Corp. (CVX), is aimed at providing Enron with additional cash liquidity to support its core energy marketing and trading operations.\n",
      "The rights provide Dynegy with the option to acquire the pipeline unit should the two companies fail to complete their merger.\n",
      "The deal, which still needs shareholder and regulatory approval, is expected to close within the next six to nine months.\n",
      "Dynegy is acquiring Enron for 0.2685 of a Dynegy share, or about $10 billion based on the recent price of Dynegy shares.\n",
      "The acquisition of Enron by its smaller rival follows a series of disclosures about Enron's financial dealings with partnerships run by some of its corporate officers.\n",
      "The dealings are under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and at the center of more than a dozen of shareholder lawsuits.\n",
      "During the last month, Enron watched as its share price sunk to a small fraction of its earlier levels as shareholder confidence in the trading company evaporated.\n",
      "As credit-rating agencies began to cut Enron's debt ratings threatening the company's investment-grade status, the company scrambled to raise additional cash to shore up its balance sheet and protect confidence in its business.\n",
      "Industry experts viewed Dynegy's cash infusion as one way the companies sought to bolster confidence in the energy trader's liquidity, and protect its most valuable business.\n",
      "In a conference call earlier Wednesday, Enron said its core energy trading business has been temporarily hurt by the uncertainty created by recent events.\n",
      "According to Dynegy spokeswoman Jennifer Rosser, the preferred stock Dynegy has received for its investment in Enron is convertible into the common stock of the Enron pipeline unit.\n",
      "Dynegy also has the right to convert the preferred stock into Enron shares if it desires, the spokeswoman said.\n",
      "For example, if Enron were to cancel its merger with Dynegy in order to accept a higher bid from another suitor, Dynegy might decide to convert its preferred shares into Enron stock in order to reap the profits created by an increase in Enron's stock price, Rosser said.\n",
      "In either case, Dynegy wouldn't be required to pay any additional consideration.\n",
      "Dynegy was able to make the cash infusion after ChevronTexaco, of San Francisco, made an investment in Dynegy.\n",
      "If the acquisition closes as anticipated, ChevronTexaco, which owns about one-fourth of Dynegy, plans to make an additional $1 billion investment in the combined company.\n",
      "ChevronTexaco also has the right to purchase an additional $1.5 billion in Dynegy stock in the first three years following the close of the acquisition.\n",
      "Enron officials said they are monitoring the energy market's reaction to the cash infusion, and hopes it will restore the confidence of its counterparties.\n",
      "Enron remains on a credit watch at the credit-rating agencies.\n",
      "Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's each have Enron rated one notch above speculative grade.\n",

      "This version indicated that direct access was suspended as of the date of the order (which would have been Sept. 6) and states in another ordering paragraph that the utilities are to advise their customers that the suspension is effective Sept. 6, 2001, specifically naming that date.\n",
      "This order would have been interpreted to suspend direct access as of Sept. 6 if it had been voted out that day.\n",
      "The other item, Agenda Item H-7A on the last agenda, is the Bilas alternate decision which calls for hearings to determine the impact of direct access on the issuance of bonds, and does not suspend direct access at this time.\n",
      "Please be advised that the suspension date contained in H-7 can and probably will be changed before the orders are considered at the CPUC meeting on Sept. 20.\n",
      "Either the Sept 6 date will be changed to the 20th of Sept., or some other specific date could be inserted at all the locations in the order dealing with the suspension date.\n",

      "Our estimates regarding the votes of commissioners Brown, Wood, and Lynch did play out, as well as the CPUC's failure to pursue retroactivity for DA agreements.\n",
      "The CPUC's move to carry forward the DA vote is not a complete surprise, as President Lynch has historically presided independently from pressure by Governor Davis.\n",
      "Dismayed that the California Legislature was unable to offer resolution, Lynch and other commissioners felt obligated to provide direction and move the state forward in securing the State's economic base.\n",
      "Note that DA agreements signed within the last three months may still be held under review by the CPUC, though no official word has yet been issued.\n",
      "The CPUC also passed two measures that were preventing the progress of California's $12.5B bond sale.\n",

      "Orange County, Coram, and San Gorgonio Farms are also suspected to have been asked to sign the petition.\n",
      "Contrary to rumor, it is not confirmed that Dynegy is considering joining Mirant and Reliant.\n",
      "However, such a move by Dynegy \"would be logical\" and note that Dynegy funded, with Mirant and Reliant, recent polling research examining the public opinion effects of such a move.\n",
      "Dynegy is reportedly discussing the possibility.\n",
      "We are attempting to determine SoCal's response to the PG&E filing, the Mirant-Reliant effort, and to try to pulse the likelihood and timing of a voluntary bankruptcy petition.\n",
      "Per earlier media reports, PG&E just announced it is filing three months early of a reorganization plan with the court.\n",
      "We believe that the utility was motivated, in part, by its desire to scuttle any chance of a state MOU with SoCal in the third special session of the Legislature.\n",
      "The reactions of key lawmakers (Burton, Bowen, Hertzberg, Keeley), and of course the Governor, will be important to watch.\n",

      "As detailed in the attached FERC notice, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved FERC's Information Collection Request for \"Reporting of Natural Gas Sales to the California Market\" through the six-month emergency period that will expire on 1/31/02.\n",
      "(Emergency reporting requirements are automatically approved for six months under the OMB regulations.)\n",
      "However, it gave FERC several conditions that would have to be met before the reporting requirements could be extended.\n",
      "OMB has advised FERC that, if it decides to request renewal of the Information Collection Request after that date, it must address certain issues as part of its supporting statement (more specifically, \"include an explicit discussion\").\n",
      "As you may remember, in addition to requesting rehearing of the FERC order, ENA and EES submitted comments to OMB regarding our problems with FERC's estimate of the burden on affected companies of the proposed collection of information.\n",
      "We pointed out that we do not manage our business in the manner contemplated by the reporting requirements, much less keep our records in that manner.\n",
      "We manage our business on an aggregated basis, and complying with the requirements will require us to implement significant manual review and analysis to arbitrarily define the components of a sale.\n",
      "We stated that we might even have to hire full-time staff to dedicate to the task.\n",
      "The issues that we raised in our comments are the same ones that OMB requires FERC to address if they submit a request for approval to extend the reporting requirements past 1/31/02.\n",
      "(FERC indicated in its July order that it intended to extend the reporting requirement through 9/30/02 to coincide with the end date of its mitigation plan.)\n",
      "OMB questioned the practical utility of requiring disaggregated data when \"commenters\" reported that they did not maintain the data in a way that allowed them to report it that way.\n",
      "OMB expressed concern that the data collection would require significant data manipulation in order to respond, and the resulting disaggregation would likely be artificial.\n",
      "OMB also required FERC to evaluate its burden estimates after \"consulting with respondents\", and it must provide a list of the names, affiliates, and phone numbers of the respondents it contacted.\n",
      "FERC has not yet issued an order on our rehearing request.\n",
      "While we would not expect them to withdraw the reporting requirements entirely, it may be that the OMB action will affect their final decision.\n",

      "Susan,  I am pleased that the PUC demonstrated some level of propriety and common sense by not acting in a retroactive manner on direct access.\n",
      "Accordingly, we are placing our work in abeyance pending further instruction.\n",
      "If any party is interested in litigating further the direct access decision from September 20, it will be necessary to petition for rehearing at the PUC.\n",
      "An aggrieved party will only be able to go to court if the PUC denies the petition for rehearing or upholds its original decision following rehearing.\n",
      "The grounds for judicial review now appear to be limited to (1) denial of procedural due process and (2) PUC conduct contrary to law.\n",
      "This latter argument is based on a statutory duty to hold hearings when deciding whether to change a policy originally decided following hearings.\n",
      "Unlike the problems caused by a retroactive decision, there is probably no basis for a stay pending final decision.\n",
      "The attached petition is the most recent generation and has fairly accurate tables of authorities and content.\n",
      "It does not have the two most recent developments (the statement by the Department of Finance indicating that bonds may not be necessary and the argument that there was a statutory duty to conduct hearings).\n",
      "If this petition is revived, those arguments can be quickly inserted.\n",

      "State utility regulators revoked the right of Californians to choose their power provider today, tossing out the centerpiece of the state's failed effort to deregulate its electricity industry.\n",
      "The California Public Utilities Commission voted 3 to 2 to immediately suspend consumers' direct access to independent power retailers.\n",
      "The move makes it easier for the state to use revenue from retail power sales to finance a record $12.5 billion bond issue this year.\n",
      "The department was chosen in January to secure electricity for most of California's 34 million residents after soaring wholesale power prices drained the state's two biggest utilities of their cash and credit.\n",
      "\"Direct access is one half of a failed and collapsed deregulation project,\" a commissioner, Carl Wood, said today.\n",
      "Mr. Wood said the other half of the problem was the law's retail rate cap, which blocked utilities from passing on the cost of power to customers, incorrectly assuming wholesale prices would fall.\n",
      "When energy supplies tightened and prices soared, the state's largest utility, Pacific Gas and Electric Company , a unit of PG&E Corporation , and Edison International 's Southern California Edison had to absorb $13 billion in unanticipated costs.\n",
      "Direct access was never a big hit.\n",
      "Despite an $80 million advertising and public relations campaign to educate Californians about deregulation and retail choice, most customers stayed with their local utilities.\n",
      "Big businesses and industrial customers, however, made deals with energy companies for cheap bulk power and wanted them to continue.\n",
      "The utility commission estimated that 5 percent of the state's peak electricity demand of 46,000 megawatts is in direct access contracts.\n",
      "About 10,000 businesses that signed new deals this summer, when wholesale power prices dropped, will be able to keep their contracts.\n",

      "The Commission issued a draft decision yesterday (September 4) on DWR's revenue requirement.\n",
      "While the Commission had been scheduled to vote on the revenue requirement at tomorrow's (September 6) meeting, the vote has been postponed to allow for comments on the PD.\n",
      "Comments are due on September 11th.\n",
      "Cmmr.\n",
      "Lynch stated at her press conference held today that it  was her intent to vote on the PD no later than the next regularly scheduled Commission meeting on September 20th, and perhaps earlier if a continuation meeting can be scheduled.\n",
      "The PD approves the entirety of DWR's requested revenue requirement of $12.6 less the costs of certain demand side management programs which are not included as \"authorized costs\" under AB1X.\n",
      "The PD does not follow DWR's approach of a pro rata allocation of the revenue requirement among the three UDCs.\n",
      "Rather the PD follows a \"cost of service\" approach.\n",
      "The PD allocates DWR's energy procurement costs on a geographic basis, depending on whether the energy is delivered over facilities in northern California or Southern California (Transmission Path 15 is the line of demarcation).\n",
      "Energy sources procured north of Path 15 are allocated to PG&E customers and those procured south of Path 15 are allocated to SCE and SDG&E customers.\n",
      "The result of such allocation is to have 54% of DWR costs allocated to PG&E, 33% to SCE and 13% to SDG&E.\n",
      "Each of the UDCs are then allocated the same percentage of bond proceeds.\n",
      "In revenue requirement terms this means that for the period of January 17, 2001 through December 31, 2002, PG&E is allocated $6.53 billion; SCE is allocated $4.01 billion and SDG&E is allocated $1.53 billion.\n",
      "Along with the revenue requirement allocation, the PD adopts a DWR charge for each UDC.\n",
      "The UDCs are directed to begin dispersing payment to DWR based on the relevant DWR charge for each kWh sold by DWR to the UDC's customer.\n",
      "For PG&E this charge is 13.99 cents/ kWh; for SCE the charge is 10.03 cents/kWh; and for SDG&E the charge is 9.02 cents/kWh.\n",
      "The PD also notes that given the fact that PG&E's DWR charge is  !3.99 cents it may need to remit to DWR an additional 4  cents for each kWh that was provided to its customers by DWR since June 1 until this order becomes effective.\n",
      "As for the necessity of raising PG&E and SCE rates to account for the DWR revenue requirement, the PD states that such a determination cannot be made until a decision on the revenue requirement for the UDCs' retained generation is issued.\n",
      "That proposed  decision is due out later this month.\n",
      "If you have any questions or would like a copy of the order, please contact me.\n",

      "For months, a special Senate committee investigating electricity price manipulation has been issuing subpoenas and gathering documents from power generators and marketers.\n",

      "As a result, he ruled, those documents handed over by Enron that contain legitimate trade secrets must be protected by a confidentiality agreement.\n",

      "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ?\n",
      "MOU Passes Assembly, Faces Fight in Senate ?\n",
      "CPUC Direct Access Delayed by Senator  SoCal Developments As reported in the press this morning, the bailout passed the Assembly late last night by a 41-32 vote.\n",
      "It will now head to the Senate, where very significant opposition is expected.\n",
      "Along with his opposition to the changes made in the Assembly regarding the size of businesses that pay the dedicated rate component for the bailout, Senator Burton also has expressed privately that he is against paying twice book value for SoCal's transmission assets.\n",
      "Senator Places Hold on CPUC Direct Access Vote Regarding the CPUC's decision to delay its hearings on the rate order and various other bond implementation measures (which led Treasurer Angelides to announce that the bond issue will have to be re-timed), this delay is due to a bill by Senator Burton that passed the Assembly Appropriations Committee yesterday.\n",
      "Burton's bill would take the place of the current proposed rate agreement (from Governor Davis) and would require greater disclosure and transparency in DWR ratemaking, as well as separate the payment streams for the bonds from payment streams for power.\n",
      "In doing so, Burton's bill preserves more PUC authority than would be preserved under the rate order currently before the PUC - thus the delay in action.\n",
      "PG&E also supports Burton's bill, which is very likely to pass the Assembly and which the governor will likely have to sign.\n",
      "If this bill is signed, PG&E's legal challenges to the DWR and PUC may be canceled.\n",
      "The popularity of Burton's bill (as opposed to the rate agreement from the Governor) is leading many observers to conclude that Burton has replaced Davis as the most powerful, influential politician in California.\n",
      "Burton's goal is to ensure that any direct access that is offered to large users in 2003 (when there will be a dip in power procurement by DWR, resulting in a net short) is only temporary and does not turn into a \"jail break.\"\n",
      "DWR's power procurement will rise again in 2004; Burton wants to ensure that businesses will have to return to purchasing power from DWR at that time.\n",
      "The CTMA is opposed to Burton's bill and to the bailout if no direct access is offered.\n",
      "The CTMA wants its members to be able to escape from buying power from the DWR (and therefore paying off the bonds) permanently in 2003.\n",

      "Almost two years after issuing a decision in PG&E's GRC, the Commission issued it rehearing order on October 16th and, lo and behold, actually granted TURN's rehearing request in part.\n",
      "The overall result is to reduce the capital revenue requirement by $24.8 million and expenses by $37.3 million.\n",

      "1.\n",
      "Electric Distribution Capital Spending.\n",
      "The Commission will, in essence, reopen the record, and allow PG&E to put into evidence how much it invested in its electric distribution plant in 1998.\n",
      "PG&E had used a 1998 forecasted amt of capital expenditures to develop its test year forecast.\n",
      "TURN argued that there was substantial evidence on the record that this amount was never spent.\n",
      "PG&E argued that the record closed prior to the end of 1998 so the best it could do was an estimate.\n",
      "On rehearing, the Commission agreed with TURN, that there was evidence that the forecasted amount was never spent, so they are allowing PG&E to prove it.\n",
      "The rehearing order states that any rates that are raised based on the electric distribution capital forecast adopted the GRC decision  may be subject to refund.\n",

      "4.\n",
      "Meter Reading.\n",
      "PG&E had primarily used accounting changes to justify the large increase in this service.\n",
      "On rehearing the Commission stated that PG&E had failed to substantiate those changes and reduced the allowed amount by $7.9 million.\n",
      "5.\n",
      "Account Services.\n",
      "On rehearing the commission stated that PG&E had failed to show (a) why it cost so much more to provide services to CIA customers  than residential customers ( $43.30 vs. $10.20); and (b) that money was not going for marketing activities that the Commission had disallowed in the previous GRC.\n",

      "If adopted by the CPUC, this would lock PG&E customers into 40-55 percent higher rates for DWR power over the next 10 years, compared to customers of Southern California Edison and SDG&E.\n",
      "It discriminates against PG&E?s customers and has not been subject to public review, due process, or cost justification by DWR or the CPUC.\n",
      "The CPUC has postponed the vote on the DWR cost shifting issue until later this month (Sept 20th, or sooner).\n",
      "Without a full public hearing at which all the cost and ratemaking issues can be aired, Northern and Central California customers will not have a full and fair opportunity to review DWR ?s multi-billion dollar rate demands and will be unable to influence these proceedings.\n",
      "The SVMG is strongly urging you to call the CPUC as well as your local legislators (contact information attached) to gain their support in opposing this unjustified and discriminatory rate shift.\n",
      "Main issues of concern are: 1)the unfair shift of over $600 million in costs from SCE customers to PG&E customers; 2)imposes higher Direct Access exit fees in Northern CA.\n",
      "than in Southern CA.\n",
      "; 3)appears to fund a portion of SCE's debt repayment on the backs of PG&E customers without any justification from the CPUC (please find further talking points attached).\n",

      "A  DASR can only be processed if the customer name appears on the ESP List submitted to the UDCs on October 5, 2001.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "In order to submit an ESP List the ESP must have a valid ESP/UDC Service Agreement as of September 20, 2001 and , for ESPs serving small customers, they must have in effect a valid Commission registration as of September 20, 2001.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "For a DASR to be processed for a residential or small commercial customer account, the ESP must be able to demonstrate that the required third party verification took place prior to September 20, 2001.\n",
      "4.\n",
      "Customers should not be allowed to switch from one ESP to another after September 20 unless the new ESP had a valid ESP- customer contract in place on or before Sept. 20th.\n",
      "5.\n",
      "Seamless moves within a UDC's service territory will be allowed.\n",
      "6.\n",
      "For customers on bundled service as of September 20, 2001 (but still under a DA contract), the UDCs are proposing not to allow such customers to process DASRs even if their names are on the October 5 list.\n",
      "7.\n",
      "If all  accounts of one ESP transferred to another as a result of a merger, then the situation is okay because no new DASR would be required; requests for one customer to switch from one ESP to another only allowed if the new ESP-customer relationship had a contract prior to Sept. 20, 2001.\n",
      "8.\n",
      "Changes in customer identity allowed on  case by case basis (e.g., if a customer changes its type of business it would not be allowed).\n",
      "9.\n",
      "One  customer can not transfer or assign its direct access service rights to another.\n",
      "10.\n",
      "Processing of DASRs submitted for customers who attempt to opt into a community aggregation program after the suspension date should not be allowed.\n",
      "In addition to the above, the UDCs proposed three additional options for implementing the suspension.\n",
      "1.\n",
      "The Commission should impose a DASR cut-off date (received and accepted).\n",
      "2.\n",
      "If the Commission does not impose a strict DASR cut off, it should require that any ESP which wishes to have a DASR processed after the cut off to submit their account specific DASR information and ESP contract to the Commission along with an explanation of why the customer is eligible to receive DA.\n",
      "The UDC will not process the DASR until it receives an okay from the Commission.\n",

      "Arthur Beesley reports     11/13/2000  Irish Times  18  Copyright (C) 2000 Irish Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)   The Competition Authority has questioned the ESB's ownership of the  electricity network in the newly deregulated power market.\n",
      "In a paper submitted to the Department of Public Enterprise, the body said  the separation of the ESB's National Grid operation from the core company did  not go far enough to ensure fair competition.\n",
      "It said arguments in favour of the ESB retaining the transmission and  distribution system ignored the 'overwhelming conclusion' that a generation  company which owns such assets 'will naturally favour itself' at the expense  of customers and reliability.\n",
      "The paper has not been published yet.\n",
      "It is believed to state, however, that  the ESB's retention of its 'non-competitive' transmission and distribution  assets and its 'competitive' electricity generation business was unwise from  a competition perspective.\n",
      "The National Grid, which controls when individual power stations feed  electricity into the network, was separated from the ESB when 27 per cent of  the market was opened last February.\n",
      "In theory, this meant the ESB could not favour its own generation stations  over more efficient competitors when deciding which plant to switch on and  off as demand for power fluctuates.\n",
      "But the authority's response to the Statutory Instrument behind the  separation - which renamed the National Grid as Eirgrid - said more should be  done to ensure the market operates fairly.\n",
      "The paper said: 'Some argue that as long as there is an independent operator  of the underlying transmission system, ownership of the transmission system  can remain in the hands of an upstream generation operator.\n",
      "'In accordance with this line of argument, the shift of operational control  of electricity transmission to Eirgrid would mean that discrimination in  dispatch [of power] and other operations would not be possible.\n",
      "However, the  Competition Authority considers that this argument ignores the overwhelming  conclusion that the generation company that owns the transmission lines will  naturally favour itself.'\n",
      "The Statutory Instrument followed complex talks, which led to an agreement  between the ESB, its trade unions and the Minister for Public Enterprise, Ms  O'Rourke.\n",
      "When Eirgrid was formed, the ESB retained ownership and responsibility to  develop and maintain the high-voltage national transmission system and the  low-voltage local distribution network.\n",
      "The authority says these, too, should be separated from the ESB to ensure the  competitive market functions fairly, according to a person familiar with its  paper.\n",
      "This would ensure equal access to the power network and an objective,  transparent, non-discriminatory treatment of all electricity generators in  the market, it said.\n",
      "The paper argues the ESB has an incentive to allocate as many costs as  possible to the operation of the transmission and distribution system.\n",

      "In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small  customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States  Petroleum Association, and Enron.\n",
      "The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).\n",
      "When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to  achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in  California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from  the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).\n",
      "In effect, \"core\" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the  utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers  would go to market.\n",
      "The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.\n",
      "The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close  devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the  utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January  and today remain very contentious).\n",
      "Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR  contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore  structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the  contracts.\n",
      "The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large  customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR  contracts.\n",
      "Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.\n",
      "Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to  address \"the DWR contract problem\" in order to prevent the contracts from 1)  killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure  focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not  include Direct Access.\n",
      "Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any  \"out clauses\" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract  provisions.\n",

      "(changes 1st paragraph, adds details, company statement)  SAN JOSE, Calif., July 6 (Reuters) - Independent power generator Calpine  Corp. said on Friday that its contracts with Pacific Gas and Electric Co.  will be altered, ensuring that Calpine will continue to supply power to the  bankrupt California utility and that it will get paid more than $250 million  for power already sold.\n",
      "Calpine stocks rose more than 14 percent, or more than $5, to $43 after the  announcement.\n",
      "As part of the contract modification, the $267 million, with interest, that  the utility, a unit of PG&E Corp , owes Calpine in past due receivables under  the contracts, will be elevated to \"administrative priority status,\" a claim  which is paid before any other general unsecured creditors.\n",
      "Calpine will get the money, in a lump sum, as soon as PG&E has a confirmed  reorganization plan, which can take as long as four to six months from now,  Calpine said.\n",
      "The move is also a step in the process of untangling California's energy  crisis, which stemmed from a flawed deregulation plan that has hit the state  with a series of rolling blackouts.\n",
      "Under the agreement, Calpine will continue to receive its contractual  capacity payments, but it has also set up a fixed rate contract for the next  five years of about 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour.\n",
      "The contracts are known as qualifying facility contracts because Calpine's  power plants are qualifying facilities.\n",
      "These types of facilities represent  more than 20 percent of the state's power supply and sell power generated  from renewable energy sources to the regulated utilities.\n",
      "\"Calpine is the first power company to modify its QF contract with PG&E to  ensure that Northern California consumers will continue to benefit from these  affordable and reliable energy resources,\" Calpine senior vice president  James Macias said in a statement.\n",

      "In a nut shell, here are the problem areas in the bill as he  sees it.\n",
      "It was a very brief conversation, but I think I've captured the key  points: Based on an expectation that the \"expedited siting\" bill would help site  plants, Dave's group had six plants on the drawing board.\n",
      "The 5 ppm requirement kills 4 of the 6, i.e., the 4 can't meet the 5 ppm  requirement.\n",
      "The requirement that the plants would either be 1) shut down after 3 years or  2) replaced with a combined-cycle plant kills the other 2 because a) shutting  down the plants in 3 years kills the economics, and b) the sites for the two  LM-6000s can't accomodate combined cylces (i.e., Dave couldn't get siting).\n",
      "In addition,the generator would be required to sign an exclusive with the ISO  (which the EOB would have to approve), which takes away the optionality of  going to the market, thus killing the economics.\n",
      "On the labor side, it's complicated, but in essence, by requiring that \"...it  be shown that the applicant has a contract with a general contractor and has  contracted for an adequate supply of skilled labor to construct, operate, and  maintain the plant,\"  it forces Dave to negotiate a labor deal before he knows what the project is  (i.e, before the project has been approved), and, it effectively prevents Enron from having the option to use internal  resources (this issue is very specific to Enron; I can explain more if folks  prefer).\n",
      "In short, bullets 1-3 would seem to affect both Enron and the market, while  the last bullet is, according to Dave, very Enron specific.\n",

      "The Assembly could not agree to the Speaker's bill because it felt the bill  was too far to the left; but 78 is even more one-sided.\n",
      "So there's a  reasonable likelihood that 78 would have to be amended considerably in order  to get the support necessary to get voted out.\n",
      "Once voted out of the Assembly, it would have to go back to the Senate, where  the Senate would have to approve it.\n",
      "Again, the Senate has adjourned, so Burton would have to round them up and  call them back for a vote, and there's no indication at this time that  Burton's inclined to come back.\n",
      "In addition, Burton has said that he's not interested in making any changes  to 78, that \"it's 78 or nothing.\"\n",
      "Consequently, for the Sentate (i.e.,  Burton) to vote it out, it would first have to agree to the Assembly's  amendments.\n",
      "Thus far, the Assembly and the Senate have not seen eye to eye  on the issues.\n",

      "The weather has been  unseasonably cool.\n",
      "His poll numbers are edging back up.\n",
      "Yet beneath this  optimistic picture lie troubling problems.\n",
      "For example, Davis's argument that  out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis has  been falling apart.\n",
      "For months, Davis has been claiming that private  generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that this  amount be refunded to the state.\n",
      "However, after a two-week mediation between  state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's  chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a huge  overcharge \"has not and cannot be substantiated.\"\n",
      "Further, while the  generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state,  perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the  state than they owe the state in refunds: \"Can a cash refund be required  where a much larger amount is due the seller?\n",
      "The chief judge thinks not.\"\n",
      "Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a \"raw deal\" and by urging  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and  the judge's conclusions and to \"step up and provide the refunds we've asked  for.\"\n",
      "Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics.\n",
      "Indeed,  Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a  \"melodramatic virtual world\" de-linked from reality.\n",
      "Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly  released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power  companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the  average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year.\n",
      "California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles  Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District  (SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state  generators.\n",
      "For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping  boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $330  per megawatt hour.\n",
      "Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion.\n",
      "A Davis  spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at \"the generators  who wear cowboy hats\" and that \"just because there are other entities that  are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off  by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte.\"\n",
      "Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, it  turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business  consumers are ripped off by state government.\n",
      "Davis has signed $43 billion in  ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price.\n",
      "The  state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the  current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state  power purchases.\n",
      "This is especially important to Davis since the high prices  are borne disproportionately by business.\n",
      "Thus, Davis' regulators are set to  eliminate \"direct access,\" which allows businesses to shop for cheaper power.\n",

      "To oversimplify it:    1) set the benchmark  2) the utility buys for consumers and tries to beat the benchmark  3) if (at the end of the year) the utility has beat the benchmark, it shares  the profits with consumers; if the benchmark wins, the utility shares the  losses with consumers  4) the PUC performs no \"after-the-fact\" reasonableness; no \"second-guessing\"  California likes the idea and is now looking to Enron to come up with what  the benchmark ought to be.\n",

      "With today's electricity demand expanding beyond the reach of available  supply, and nationwide electric deregulation efforts providing inconsistent  results, distributed power just may be the next big thing, according to Bear  Stearns analyst Robert Winters.\n",
      "With technology-laden, electricity-hungry companies popping up every time you  turn around, and blackouts and brownouts occurring more frequently as large  power grids are becoming less reliable, the analyst points towards  distributed energy services as a possible solution, and maybe the \"next big  investment opportunity for the coming decade.\"\n",
      "In Winters' 250 page report,  \"Distributed Energy Services-The World's Power and Transportation Industries:  Set for a Revolution-Part 2,\" he examines technologies and companies within  the distributed energy services sector that might be able to take advantage  of the current situation.\n",
      "\"Thanks to major technological advances and energy deregulation, a wave of  new investment in the power industry has just begun.\n",
      "We believe that this  coming era in the power industry could resemble the wave of investments which  flooded into the telecommunications industry following the breakup of AT&T in  the early 1980's,\" said Winters.\n",
      "\"Companies and municipalities need to find ways to ensure the availability of  high quality, reliable power,\" added Winters.\n",
      "According to his research,  microturbines are the best positioned of the \"new\" technologies that would be  able to have an immediate impact on electric generation.\n",
      "He based his recommendation on the fact that microturbines are small, quiet,  efficient and very versatile.\n",
      "\"They can be used as a main power source, a  back-up power source or as an alternative when there is a spike in  traditional energy prices,\" the analyst said.\n",
      "\"Microturbines can also be used  in remote locations, including developing countries, that do not have access  to electricity.\"\n",
      "Another attractive feature of microturbines is their fuel  requirements.\n",
      "The units often use natural gas, but can also use several other  fuels as well.\n",
      "In the study, the analyst also examined fuel cells, flywheel technology, and  existing reciprocating engines technologies such as diesel engines and  Stirling engines, which he noted are enjoying a comeback.\n",
      "In addition to the report, Winters initiated coverage on two distributed  energy companies.\n",
      "He labeled Active Power, a company that is pioneering  flywheel technology, as a \"buy\" and Capstone Turbine Corp., a leading  manufacturer of microturbines, as \"attractive.\"\n",

      "When December's over, the utility compares forecast prices with actual  prices.\n",

      "The interconnection rules are currently so vague and ambiguous, that the  utility could quite easily favor its generation sub over competitors.\n",

      "DISTRIBUTED GENERATION And the same goes for DG:  in California many are pointing to DG as a viable  solution to the price spikes.\n",
      "If the utility loses sales because a customer has installed DG on her  premises as a hedge against price spikes, the utility will have an incentive  to thwart interconnection of the DG unit.\n",
      "(Recall that in many places,  recovery of distribution costs is derived from kwh sales; and if sales go  down, so can recovery of the utilities' distribution-related costs).\n",
      "In addition, if someone attempts to install DG at the grid level (as opposed  to on-site DG) and sell the DG power in wholesale and retail markets, the  utility has the ability to frustrate the DG project via interconnection.\n",

      "We proposed that:  The Commission has the authority to raise rates without addressing the rate  freeze issue.\n",

      "Under the rate  freeze, the utility is at risk for procurement costs that exceed the rate  freeze.)\n",

      "By Jonathan Stempel  01/03/2001  Reuters English News Service  (C) Reuters Limited 2001.\n",
      "NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Bankruptcy may loom and the credit ratings of the  two largest California electric utilities will likely fall too far if that  state's Public Utilities Commission awards them an interim rate hike of 7 to  15 percent, analysts said Wednesday.\n",
      "In a draft decision on Wednesday, the CPUC proposed an immediate hike of 9  percent for residential customers of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern  California Edison, and hikes of seven to 15 percent for various business  customers.\n",
      "The CPUC commission is expected to issue a final decision on Thursday.\n",
      "\"It forces the utilities and their creditors to be limbo dancers, and skilled  limbo dancers at that,\" said Shawn Burke, head of U.S. investment-grade  research at Barclays Capital.\n",
      "PG&E and SCE had requested respective rate increases of 26 percent and 30  percent, a hike that would help them avoid imminent bankruptcy.\n",
      "The utilities have also asked the regulators to remove a freeze on retail  rates imposed under California's 1996 law that deregulated the state's  electricity market.\n",
      "On a day when most stocks roared ahead after the Federal Reserve announced  surprise interest rate cuts, investors beat down the stocks of Pacific G&E's  parent, San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. , and SoCal Edison's parent, Edison  International .\n",
      "PG&E shares closed Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $17, down  $2-9/16, or 13.1 percent, while Edison International shares closed at  $12-1/4, down $2-3/4, or 18.3 percent, on the Big Board.\n",
      "Bond quotations were not immediately available for the utilities' bonds,  which in recent weeks have traded like junk.\n",
      "Pacific G&E and SoCal Edison were banking on a big rate hike to allow them to  pass on some of their soaring wholesale power costs to consumers.\n",
      "The utilities, which operate under a rate freeze, have accumulated more than  $8 billion in unrecovered costs since wholesale power prices started  skyrocketing last summer amid a worsening electricity shortage in the state.\n",
      "They claim they are running out of money due to the price freeze, and have  billions of dollars of bills coming due in the next six weeks.\n",
      "Central to their concerns is whether credit rating agencies Moody's Investors  Service and Standard & Poor's will cut their medium investment grades to junk  status.\n",
      "\"No one knows for sure, but if we consider the average rate hike is only  about 10 percent, it will be difficult for the companies to maintain  investment-grade ratings,\" said Dorothea Matthews, a fixed-income electric  utilities analyst for Deutsche Banc Alex.\n",
      "Brown.\n",
      "The utilities have already been unable to tap short-term capital markets  because of their precarious financial state.\n",
      "Downgrades to junk, which the agencies have already threatened, would cement  the door shut to these markets, and cause the utilities to default on some of  their loans.\n",
      "Late Wednesday, PG&E Chief Executive Gordon Smith said the commission's  proposed hikes could jeopardize his utility's future loans.\n",
      "Even a downgrade to the lowest investment grades - \"Baa3\" for long-term debt  and \"Prime-3\" for short-term debt from Moody's, and \"BBB-minus\" and \"A3\" from  S&P - would make the going very difficult for the utilities.\n",
      "The reason:  short-term debt markets are often closed to companies with those ratings.\n",
      "\"Unless this process allows the rating agencies to keep 'A2/P2' ratings on  the short-term debt of both companies, then this process has largely been a  waste of everyone's time,\" said Burke.\n",
      "Still, he said, \"there is a reasonable chance, despite today's weak  recommendation, that the situation can be salvaged with mid-'triple-B'  ratings, which would allow a lifeline to conventional sources of liquidity.\"\n",

      "Since we are not a \"generator,\" we buy and sell in the market, which as you  know is currently very volatile.\n",

      "These prices were  put together and filed yesterday, but you may have heard that prices were  down today.\n",

      "Politicians have concluded that the crisis is largely beyond their control  and the die is more or less cast.\n",
      "Whatever fate decrees - massive summer  blackouts, soaring utility bills or even the bankruptcy of the state's  utilities - will happen, and politicians from Gov.\n",
      "Gray Davis downward are  scrambling to insulate themselves from voters' anger and single out rivals  for blame.\n",
      "No one is saying that publicly, of course, but the fatalistic mood is very  apparent in the Capitol, whose denizens have dropped their preoccupation with  energy and moved to other matters.\n",
      "Legislative committees are working on the  hundreds of bills that had been stalled for three months while the special  committees that had been holding almost daily sessions on the energy crisis  have gone into semihibernation.\n",
      "Last weekend's Democratic state convention in Anaheim was dominated by fears  that when the crisis hits home, the party's dominance of the Capitol will  backfire.\n",
      "\"Just remember Jimmy Carter,\" state Controller Kathleen Connell  warned fellow Democrats, adding that they will have \"no excuses\" for  perceived failure to deal with the crisis forthrightly.\n",
      "\"We will be  accountable on Election Day 2002,\" she said.\n",
      "Next year's elections are very much on Davis' mind, since he'll be seeking a  second term and polls indicate that his approval ratings have declined  sharply in recent weeks.\n",
      "He devoted much of the weekend to defending his  actions, saying, \"I believe we've moved at warp speed to address this  problem,\" and trying to pin blame on Republicans.\n",
      "Republicans, meanwhile, sense that the crisis gives them an avenue of escape  from the dungeon of irrelevancy to which they had been exiled by heavy losses  in the last three elections.\n",
      "The only remaining statewide GOP officeholder,  Secretary of State Bill Jones, is running for governor by accusing Davis of  mismanagement, and Republican Assembly members dumped their leader, Bill  Campbell, on grounds that he had been insufficiently aggressive vis-a-vis  Davis.\n",
      "The political positioning reflects the reality that the crisis shows every  sign of worsening.\n",
      "Although Davis' office is distributing a brochure entitled  \"Meeting the Energy Challenge\" to defend the governor's actions, it's  apparent that none of the steps the governor has taken is bearing much fruit.\n",
      "The state is spending at least $50 million a day on emergency power  purchases, but what was supposed to be a short-term program has evolved into  a monthslong drain on the state's rapidly shrinking budget reserves.\n",
      "The  long-term supply contracts that were supposed to replace daily spot purchases  have bogged down, and without firm contracts and a revenue stream to pay for  them, Wall Street is reluctant to market the bonds the state wants to float.\n",
      "Many authorities now believe Davis' decision to step into the power purchase  market in January was a strategic error because it gave power suppliers a  deep new pocket to tap just as the utilities themselves ran out of credit.\n",
      "Davis, meanwhile, is refusing to embrace a rate increase approved by the  state Public Utilities Commission, which sends a mixed message to Wall  Street, and efforts to resolve problems with unpaid bills from power  generators and have the state acquire the utilities' intercity transmission  grid have stalled, perhaps permanently.\n",
      "The crisis may careen totally out of control as summer arrives, raising the  specter of elderly and/or ill Californians dying from having their air  conditioners or medical equipment shut down.\n",

      "But there is far less support for either conservation or price caps; 18  percent identified conservation as the most important solution, and just 8  percent favored federal price controls on generators.\n",

      "6, November 26, 2001   Benson, Defense Stifle Ags; Huge Upsets Propel Horns Into Big 12 Title Game Against Colorado  As Longhorn defensive coordinator Carl Reese noted, it was an old-fashioned, rock-em, sock-em game in College Station before a state record football crowd of 87,555 Friday, and Texas won it with a gritty defense and two late touchdowns by outstanding freshman RB Cedric Benson.\n",
      "After taking the 21-7 victory, head coach Mack Brown congratulated the team on its fine 10-1 season and said he wasn't worried about the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) \"because we'll be in it.\"\n",
      "I don't know if had a crystal ball, but immediately after the Longhorns' expected victory, top-rated Nebraska was humiliated, 62-36, by Colorado, and the next day No.\n",

      "3 spot in both major polls and put the Longhorns back in control of their own destiny for the first time since that 14-3 loss to OU back in October.\n",
      "Texas plays Colorado Saturday at 7 p.m. in Irving's Texas Stadium for the Big 12 Championship and an automatic berth in one of the four BCS bowls, possibly even the Rose Bowl in the national title game.\n",
      "But the bad news is that a loss to the stampeding Buffaloes would knock the Longhorns out of the BCS mix.\n",
      "Brown and his players are tickled orange, however, at the chance to play for the conference championship.\n",
      "\"The BCS isn't an issue today,\" Brown said Saturday after the huge upset in Norman.\n",
      "\"The Bowl game isn't an issue today.\"\n",
      "\"We said we needed to get to the championship game,\" he said, \"but once you get there, you need to win.\n",
      "After that, you just look up and try to figure out where you are.\"\n",
      "\"People have been asking us about the BCS for five weeks,\" Brown said.\n",
      "\"Obviously we said we needed to wait until the end (of the season) and the end's not even near where it should be.\"\n",
      "\"People haven't given us or Colorado a chance to be in this game for five weeks.\n",
      "To our kids' credit and to Colorado's kids credit, they kept working hard and now they are in this game.\"\n",
      "The coaches and players have to forget the Aggie game and get ready for the Buffaloes, but we can enjoy it just a little longer.\n",
      "This was a game where the defenses weren't going to give up a lot, but the Longhorns got an early special teams touchdown when CB Roderick Babers blocked a punt and WR Tony Jeffery scooped it up and scored.\n",
      "The Aggies tied it on a 27-yard drive after a fine punt return in the third quarter when they had the benefit of the strong wind, which was around 15 miles per hour with frequent gusts to 25 or 30 miles per hour.\n",
      "But Nathan Vasher made a couple of good punt returns and Texas started the pivotal fourth quarter with the wind and a drive into Aggie territory that changed the field position for the rest of the game.\n",
      "After a short Aggie punt midway through the period, the Longhorns rode Benson's strong legs to a touchdown, then they got another from the powerful freshman after Everick Rawls' interception in the final two minutes.\n",
      "Here, briefly, is how the game went First Quarter Texas won the toss and deferred.\n",
      "After each defense got a quick stop, the Aggies were stymied a second time and Babers blocked the punt and Jeffery returned it 23 yards for a Longhorn TD and a 7-0 lead with 7:44 left.\n",
      "Another three-and-out by the Aggies, followed by a shanked punt, gave Texas possession at the UT 47.\n",
      "The Horns made one first down and Dusty Mangum missed a 49-yard field goal try.\n",
      "Defenses dominated the quarter.\n",
      "A&M led in first downs, 3-2, and in total yardage, 40-25.\n",
      "Second Quarter A shanked punt by UT's Brian Bradford set the Aggies up at the Longhorn 47.\n",
      "A&M couldn't move, but punted the ball dead at the UT 7.\n",
      "The Longhorn offense, which had done little with the stiff wind, couldn't move into it, and Bradford's 30-yard punt, a good one into the wind, gave A&M possessiion at the UT 39.\n",
      "The Aggies made a first  down at the 26 before stalling.\n",
      "Cody Scates missed a 43-yard field goal attempt.\n",
      "An interception of a long pass at the UT 5 by safety Ahmad Brooks with just under five minutes left in the half finally pumped a little life into the Longhorn offense, which drove to midfield and killed all but 50 seconds of the half before stalling.\n",
      "Texas had a 7-5 lead in first downs and a 92-60 lead in total offense at intermission.\n",
      "Third Quarter Texas got the ball going into the wind to start the second half.\n",
      "The Horns couldn't move and punted.\n",
      "A&M's Mickey Jones almost tied the game on the punt return, starting right, then racing left and going down the sideline for 37 yards before being pushed out of bounds at the UT 27.\n",
      "The Aggies hit a pass to the UT 8, then 220-pound RB Keith Joseph took over, powering to the left to the 4, then taking a pitchout to the right for the TD to tie the game with 10:41 left.\n",
      "The Horns came right back with a good drive to midfield, sparked by two passes from Simms to TE Bo Scaife.\n",
      "But, facing fourth down with an inch or two needed, a lineman flinched and UT drew a 5-yard penalty and had to punt.\n",
      "Fourth Quarter Benson, who had been stymied throughout the first three quarters, got 5 and then 24 yards on his first two carries of the final period, getting the Horns to the Aggie 45.\n",
      "But the UT offense stalled again and Bradford's punt was killed at the Aggie 8.\n",
      "The Texas defense force a quick punt into the wind and Vasher alertly ran up and caught the short punt at the A&M 40 and returned it to the 35.\n",
      "Benson got loose for 12 to the 23, then got 5 and 2 to the 16.\n",
      "On third and 3, Simms hit Scaife coming across the middle  to the A&M 5.\n",
      "Benson powered through the right side for the TD on the next play.\n",
      "Mangum's kick put UT on top, 14-7, with 7:22 left.\n",
      "Rawls interception at the A&M 27 and return to the 12 with 1:59 left set up the final UT touchdown.\n",
      "Benson got 1, then ran through a big hole and powered through two defenders for the TD and the final 21-7 count.\n",

      "Part 3  Recruiting Roundup  Today (Monday) was the day the Longhorn coaches could start another big recruiting push by going to top recruits' schools and homes, but the big game Saturday has pushed that back a week.\n",
      "But don't worry about it.\n",
      "Coach Mack Brown wrote the book on recruiting and his previous four classes at Texas have been very good, and some of them have been great.\n",
      "This year's class has a chance to be as good as any Brown and his assistants have signed.\n",
      "There's a chance it could be the best of the bunch, even better than the top-rated Chris Simms, Cory Redding class.\n",
      "They already have 16 commitments, about half of them from players who have been on at least one national top 100 list, and their class already is ranked as one of the top five in the nation.\n",
      "Let's take a look at where they are and where they are going: OFFENSE Quarterback UT has a commitment from Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar, who is a lot better than most of the gurus think, and the Horns have close to a 50-50 shot at Vincent Young, the wonder kid at Houston Madison, who had his usual game Friday for the undefeated Marlins, doing everything on offense and even running an interception back for a touchdown.\n",
      "(Yes, he plays defense, too, when needed.)\n",

      "Wide Receiver National top 100 star Marquis Johnson of Champaign, Ill., and Dustin Miksch of Round Rock Westwood are already committed.\n",
      "Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus, a supremely talented player who has little playing experience because of transfer problems, is a possibility, and, if the Horns don't get him, they might wind up with Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls or Anthony Wright of Klein Forest.\n",
      "Line The Horns already have a pledge from Neale Tweedie of Allen, a great pass blocker who is on several national top 100 lists, and from Brett Valdez of Brownwood, a tremendous run blocker.\n",
      "They are still recruiting Justin Blalock of Plano East and Tony Ugoh of Spring Westfield.\n",
      "Blalock is the best run blocker I've seen this year.\n",

      "Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch, Colo, who excels at DT and OG, also is a strong possibility.\n",

      "He is the son of David Studdard, a former UT offensive line star who had a long career with the Denver Broncos.\n",

      "A. J. Nicholson of Winston Salem, N. C., and Aaron Thomas of North Mesquite are national top 100 middle backers who are strongly considering Texas, and Michael Williams of Lindale and Rufus Alexander of Baton Rouge Christian Life, are fast outside backers the Horns are recruiting.\n",

      "Jerry Scarbrough's True Orange The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful  Volume 12, No.\n",
      "3, October 29, 2001   Simms Throws 4 TD Passes, Benson Rushes For 157 Yards as Longhorns Gore Tigers, 35-16  Junior QB Chris Simms and true freshman RB Cedric Benson had career-best days and the UT defense held Missouri to just one first down in the first and third quarters Saturday in Columbia to lead Texas to a 35-16 victory.\n",
      "On a day when upsets reigned across the country, particularly in the top 10, and five of the eight previously unbeaten teams lost, the Longhorns took care of business and ran their record to 7-1 overall and 4-1 in the Big 12.\n",
      "With Oklahoma's 20-10 loss at Nebraska, the Sooners, Longhorns and Aggies are all tied atop the standings in the Big 12 South.\n",
      "But the Longhorns have to win out and Oklahoma has to lose another conference game for the Longhorns to make it to the Big 12 Championship Game.\n",
      "Saturday's victory at Missouri was a fairly easy conquest, thanks to the stout UT defense and a great performance by the offensive line that allowed Simms to complete 24 of 30 passes (80%) for 229 yards and four touchdowns and Benson to run for 157 yards on 31 carries, an average of 5.1 yards a pop.\n",
      "But some strange things happened to thwart the Longhorns in the early going.\n",
      "On their first drive, for example, they held the ball almost 10 minutes, rolling 78 yards in 19 plays, but they got zero points because they stalled at the Tiger 2 and Dusty Mangum missed the chip-shot field goal.\n",
      "They also drove into Missouri territory on their second possession, but again stalled.\n",
      "Missouri finally got rolling to start the second quarter and scored first.\n",
      "That seemed to wake up the Longhorn offense and it took control and wore out the Missouri defenders.\n",
      "Here, briefly, is how the game went First Quarter Texas won the toss and deferred.\n",
      "Missouri took the ball and Marcus James ran the UT kick back to the 38.\n",
      "The Longhorn defense forced a quick three-and-out and the UT offense had its most time-consuming drive of the year, going 78 yards in a laborious 10-minute, 19-play drive to the Tiger 2, but Dusty Mangum missed the chip-shot field goal.\n",
      "Missouri went three-and-out again.\n",
      "The Horns drove to midfield again, but stalled as the quarter ended.\n",
      "Texas had a huge lead in statistics, with 7 first downs to 0 for Missouri, a 99-24 edge in total offense, and a 12:03 to 2:57 bulge in time of possession, but the game was all even at 0-0 in the only statistic that counts.\n",
      "Second Quarter The Tigers finally got their offense untracked to start the second quarter and drove 76 yards, primarily on the passing of QB Kirk Farmer, to take a 7-0 lead with 11:12 left.\n",
      "Victor Ike ran the kickoff back to the 36 and the Longhorns went 64 yards in 10 plays to tie it up.\n",
      "Simms connected with WR B. J. Johnson on the 5-yard TD toss, but the big play was a 27-yarder from Simms to TE Bo Scaife on third-and-2 at the Missouri 32.\n",
      "Mangum's kick tied it, 7-7, with 5:44 left.\n",
      "After the UT defense forced another quick 3-and-out and got a short punt, Simms found Scaife again on the first play for a 28-yard gain to the MU 13.\n",
      "A WR reverse by Johnson got 5 yards and Benson got 5 more and a first down at the 3 before Simms faked to Benson and hit TE Brock Edwards for the final 3 yards and the TD.\n",
      "Mangum's kick gave Texas a 14-7 lead with 1:50 left.\n",
      "The Tigers stormed down the field in the final two minutes, primarily on the running of 5-10, 225-pound Zack Abron, who gained 37 yards in three carries.\n",
      "His 16-yard tackle-breaking run to the 5 gave the Tigers a first-and-goal, but his next try gained only a yard and Farmer threw two incompletions before Brad Hammerich booted a 22-yard field goal to cut the UT lead to 14-10 with 7 seconds left.\n",
      "The Tigers outgained the Longhorns in the quarter, 120 to 104 yards and had a 9-5 edge in first downs.\n",
      "Third Quarter Texas got the ball and again made a long, time-consuming drive, but this time it counted because Simms scored from the 1 to cap a 73-yard drive and Mangum converted for  a 21-10 lead with 8:50 left.\n",
      "the Longhorns overcame a third-and-11 early in the drive when Simms scrambled and found Brett Robin for 24 yards.\n",
      "Vasher intercepted Farmer four plays later to give the Horns great field position at the MU 48.\n",
      "The Longhorns couldn't move, but the pick kept Missouri bottled up deep in its own territory throughout the quarter and allowed Texas to start its possessions around midfield in a quarter that was dominated by defense after Texas' impressive opening drive.\n",
      "The Tigers made only one first down in the quarter and Texas, after getting five first downs on that opening TD drive, managed only one more in the entire quarter.\n",
      "Fourth Quarter The Tigers finally figured out their best offense  was to hand the ball to Abron and he bulled for 16, 19, 3 and then 7 more for a TD.\n",
      "Missouri's pass for a 2-point conversion failed and left UT on top, 28-16, with 7:41 left.\n",
      "Not to be outdone, Benson shredded the Missouri defense for 11, 20 and then 4 before Simms scrambled left and found  Robin, who scampered the final 25 yards to complete a 39-yard scoring play.\n",
      "Mangum's kick gave Texas a 35-16 lead with 4:27 left.\n",
      "Texas and the BCS  The next Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings will be a lot different from the first ones that were announced last week and Texas will be a lot higher than it was in the last one.\n",
      "In the first standings, which were announced last Monday, Texas was ranked No.\n",
      "6 behind five teams with perfect records.\n",
      "The BCS standings are like golf in that the lowest score is the best score.\n",
      "Oklahoma came in at No.\n",
      "1 in the first standings at 3.06, followed by Nebraska at 6.40, UCLA at 8.34, Miami at 12.01, Virginia Tech at 13.88, Texas at 15.35 and Michigan at 15.91, to round out the top seven.\n",
      "But a rash of upsets claimed OU, UCLA and Virginia Tech.\n",
      "Since OU lost to Nebraska, the Sooners won't tumble far, but Texas should pass UCLA and VT. Of course, Michigan is so close to Texas that the Wolverines might pass the Horns if they keep winning.\n",
      "Under the BCS formula, the top four teams in the final standings are guaranteed berths in one of the four BCS Bowls, which are the Rose, Orange, Fiesta and Sugar.\n",
      "The Rose Bowl will get the national title game this year.\n",
      "Right now, that looks like a Nebraska-Miami battle, but both teams have some big games left before making that date.\n",
      "Texas could make it to the Rose Bowl, but it would require some big upsets, like Texas A&M or Texas Tech upsetting Oklahoma, and then Texas beating Nebraska in the Big 12 title game.\n",
      "But the Longhorns will make it to one of the big BCS bowls if they keep winning.\n",
      "Key Games for BCS Watchers  If you want to keep tabs on the Longhorns' chances to wind up in good shape in one of the big four BCS bowls, the key is that they have to win their final three regular season games.\n",
      "Assuming that happens, here are some key games to watch for the rest of the season: This Saturday's key games are Michigan at Michigan State, Tennessee at Notre Dame and UCLA at Washington State.\n",
      "The big ones the following Saturday, Nov. 10, are Texas A&M at Oklahoma and UCLA at Oregon.\n",

      "I think radical change is not the answer.\n",
      "The answer lies in a combination  of a) slight changes in process; b) increasing participation/ownership at key  points in the process by certain business units and people; and c) a credible  key business spokesman or spokespersons co-opting the other units where  necessary and providing the commercial leadership and representation for the  program internally.\n",
      "Overall this is a commercial program that needs to meet  commercial objectives - the closer to the front the better.\n",
      "The goals of any restructuring are:  a) eliminate the perception that the program is not receptive to the  business units needs or any bu's perception that they lack ownership for the  program;  b) increase the quality of the recruits that are brought in and retained;  c) ensure we have the best people in the organization recruiting, selling  and interviewing;  d) ensure that we have the best commercial training program that firmly  grounds the associate in the \"Enron technology\" which include skills in  market understanding, structuring, finance, logistics and risk;  e) ensure the business units have the ability to identify the outstanding  talent early and give those people the responsibility necessary to move them  up the curve quickly (ie) quickly identify the Whalley/Lavorato's in the  program and, on the flip side, quickly deal with clear non-performance issues;  f) review the effectiveness of the current PRC process as a development,  retention and performance tool;  g) incorporate mid-year flexibility, internet recruiting techniques,  non-traditional sources of talent and  h) increase cost effectiveness.\n",

      "Jeff, you will be receiving a DASH from the principal investing group which  does not fit well into some of the charter criteria; however, I do think this  is a venture we should support.\n",
      "In a nutshell, it is providing $10MM, in  seed capital, to be used in the start up of a new distributed generation  company having the primary mission of designing, fabricating and marketing  2MW to 22MW mobile turbine-generator sets.\n",
      "These units are fully mobile via  the nations highways and can meet single digit NOX requirements given current  SCR technology.\n",
      "They are primarily utilized for back-up power, emergency  power, VAR creation and peaker application and are fully dual fuel capable.\n",
      "The ultimate vision is a fleet of mobile/flexible/low cost generator sets  that can be put in place very quickly in the most stringent emissions and  constrained electrical regions and relocated when market conditions change.\n",
      "The benefits include:  a) 50% plus interest in a new distributed generation company with the  opportunity to raise private funds at later rounds and ultimately the  possibility of an IPO - similar companies in this space include Active Power,  Capstone and Elektryon;  b) origination opportunities - the ENA mid-stream origination groups believe  that there are numerous opportunities (2001 to 2002 time frame) to utilize  this technology to take advantage of market opportunities and customer  applications;  c) learning - the distributed generation/renewable space is an area of  critical importance for ENA and EES to understand.\n",
      "If ENA through this  venture can make this technology work, it could be a very powerful tool in  our network used to capture opportunity and manage risk;  d) low risk - it is expected that roughly 50% of the initial seed capital  would be recoverable through asset sales if for some reason the technology  did not work or the market did not materialize;  e) low tech - this solution utilizes existing turbine/SCR technology;  and f) ENA would have a controlling position in this new venture.\n",
      "However, this venture is different than Active Power and several other  Principal Investing investments in that a) it is a very early stage company  and b) ENA will have to provide or procure a complete management team if the  technology proves out.\n",
      "Given, that we could benefit most from the successful  application of this venture, it is worth the initial work.\n",
      "Our partner is Power Systems Manufacturing of Boca Raton, Florida.\n",
      "We have a  very solid history with this company.\n",
      "They have successfully solved many of  the technical issues surrounding the Korean 6B's which are currently  operating at New Albany.\n",
      "They would bring the technical and engineering  expertise at cost for their 50%.\n",
      "ENA would ultimately have a buy-out clause  at a fixed number for their 50% .\n",

      "I would hope that the Mexican and Canadian teams would lead the  sales process and the Houston team lead the structuring, customer facing and  execution but I will let you decide the optimum mix.\n",
      "Either way, I am  expecting this target list completed and agreed to in the next two weeks for  Canada and Mexico;  and d) for Tembec I don't think it makes sense to change the deal team at  this point; however, the US team will keep the Canadian team in the loop and  if the products become non-outsourcing related the deal should be passed to  ECC.\n",

      "We commenced our work based on discussions with Jim Fallon, Ray Bowen and others about a week ago and plan to pay the employees with funds currently held by EEFT.\n",
      "I expect to receive tomorrow a formalized structure for the teams, again organized around EEFT.\n",
      "As I understand it, however, this proposal will not address any retention bonuses for the teams because this issue is still under discussion.\n",
      "I have been told that there is hesitancy on the part of some in Houston to provide for such payments but I do not know the reason for that hesitancy.\n",
      "May I suggest that it would be entirely appropriate to provide for retention payments in this case.\n",
      "As I have mentioned, part of this project is to recover value from existing contracts in entities such as ECTRIC, which value is estimated in the aggregate to be $150 to 200 million.\n",
      "Another aspect of the Corp. interest project is to properly wind up entities so as to recover value and minimize director liabilities.\n",
      "A proposal was made that a percentage of the recovered value would be put into a bonus pool and shared among all of the team members, whether those individuals had focused on recovery of funds or minimizing liabilities.\n",
      "I am told that this proposal was rejected in a conference call held today.\n",
      "I am very concerned about our ability to keep people working on this project without some additional incentive.\n",
      "The project is extremely difficult and many people, in particular the traders who are in a position to protect value in ECTRIC, have other job options.\n",
      "In addition, the employees on the team are aware that many individuals who are working on PWC teams are receiving retention payments.\n",
      "If the team to protect the ECTRIC interests is not retained in the short term, ECTRIC is scheduled to be put into administration on January 4, resulting in termination of many of its in-the-money contracts and a loss of an estimated 50% of its value.\n",

      "F&J probably could not simply send us our files back and put itself in a position to be adverse to us with Arthur Anderson.\n",

      "Susman would not, however, agree to a broad advance ethical waiver, as proposed by F&J.\n",
      "He does not believe such waivers are effective.\n",
      "Susman would agree to a waiver once we were advised who F&J wanted to represent.\n",
      "I don't know whether F&J would agree to this or not.\n",
      "4.\n",
      "Susman recognizes that we cannot force F&J to take on the new Mariner matter, and that this is ultimately a risk/benefit decision for us to make, and that we may have to agree to terms that we otherwise wouldn't agree to.\n",
      "Parenthetically, I have received no comments on F&J's proposed waiver letter.\n",
      "Under the circumstances, from his standpoint, Bob is inclined for us to get the best deal on the waiver letter that we can with F&J, but that if F&J won't budge, that we take something along the lines of what they have given us (Bob, let me know if I have mischaracterized your thoughts).\n",
      "From my standpoint, I unfortunately think there are some parts of the letter that we must have changed.\n",
      "This would be to the extent that the letter purports to have Enron Corp. agree to bind all the Enron entities, and to the extent that it involves Enron's agreement to what will happen after the Dynegy merger (as I set out in my earlier e-mail).\n",
      "My recommendation would be, as set forth in my earlier e-mail, that only the Enron entities currently being represented by F&J sign it and be bound by it, and to remove the language regarding what Enron would agree to after the Dynegy merger.\n",
      "I also find the advance ethical waiver language repugnant, but could agree to it if the other modifications mentioned could be made.\n",
      "I do not know whether F&J would be willing to make these changes or not.\n",

      "Gentlemen -  Following the Dabhol dictate that \"bad news is good news,\" Dabhol is getting some good news this week.\n",
      "As reported in the press, DPC did receive a two-page letter from MSEB purporting to rescind the PPA with immediate effect because DPC materially misrepresented the capabilities of the power plant (i.e., 6 hour actual ramp-up time vs. 3 hour ramp-up schedule in the PPA).\n",
      "However, the letter goes on to state that MSEB is \"agreeable to continue the present arrangement of power and payment until disputes are resolved by the appropriate forum.\"\n",
      "We are not entirely sure what this last part means and are asking MSEB for clarification.\n",
      "Obviously, this letter is quite a buttress to our already-delivered PTN contending that MSEB has evidenced an intention not to be bound by the PPA.\n",
      "While MSEB's letter seems to state that they will still honor some aspects of the PPA, the letter adds that \"payments would be subject to adjustments on the basis of determination of reasonable compensation and quantum meruit by a competent authority.\"\n",
      "We hear rumors that MSEB will approach the Maharasthra Energy Regulatory Commission (MERC) for a \"how much should we pay DPC\" determination.\n",
      "If they do so and MERC accepts jurisdiction, this would help our expropriation, political force majeure and default arguments.\n",
      "DPC seems to have managed to avoid a construction contractor termination in May by agreeing to extend the required completion date for Block B by 9 days.\n",
      "While this action does not have long-term benefits to the project, I believe that it was a considerable sign of good faith that DPC is trying to give the lenders some time to assess whether they want to begin curing project agreement defaults on an ongoing basis.\n",

      "BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.\n",
      "The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.\n",
      "Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.\n",
      "Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000.\n",
      "The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities.\n",
      "The current contract lasts for five months.\n",
      "Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.\n",
      "Enron in the Middle East  Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.\n",

      "Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub.\n",
      "Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was  to set up a working group similiar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub.\n",
      "More than 40 companies participated in the meeting, representing producers, end users, Dutch and German transportation companies, marketing, and trading companies.\n",
      "More than 12 companies, including Ruhrgas and Gaz de France, were interested in joining the working group, but in the end the decision was taken to restrict the number of companies making up the working group to eight so as to ensure effecient and effective decision-making.\n",
      "The following companies were elected to become members of the working group: Centrica, Gasunie, Wingas, BEB, Statoil, Distrigaz, Duke Energy and Enron.\n",
      "Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!\n",

      "NGI's Daily Gas Price Index  published : October 29, 2001 ALJ Clears Transwestern of Market Power Charges  A FERC administrative law judge has found no improprieties, nor evidence of the exercise of market power in negotiated rate contracts between Transwestern Pipeline and two shippers on its system, which resulted in the shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's allowed transportation rate of 38 cents/MMBtu (RP97-288-009).\n",
      "ALJ Jacob Leventhal had only one fault to find, and that was with Transwestern's method of posting capacity.\n",
      "The judge said, and Transwestern agreed, to modify its tariff \"so that all posting, bidding and award procedures are set forth in a separate provision with an appropriate caption\" on its Internet bulletin board.\n",
      "Shippers had said that reviewing capacity on the Transwestern web site was \"a tortuous process.\"\n",
      "Indicated Shippers claimed Transwestern's inadequate capacity posting and award procedures did not provide all interested parties with an opportunity to bid for the capacity that was available.\n",
      "While \"both Indicated Shippers and (FERC) Staff find it curious that SET (Sempra Energy Trading) and Richardson (Products Co.) were the sole bidders on the contracts awarded to each of them...curiosity does not translate into proof,\" the judge said.\n",
      "Witnesses in the expedited hearing testified no bids were considered in advance of the capacity posting.\n",
      "The judge subsequently found the capacity was awarded in a manner consistent with Transwestern's tariff.\n",
      "Similarly, Levanthal could find no evidence that Transwestern exercised market power in negotiating the rates with shippers or withholding or threatening to withhold capacity.\n",
      "The capacity was available at recourse rates, and the shippers knew those rates were available.\n",
      "\"Staff's arguments really are criticisms of the posting and award procedures, but do not demonstrate the exercise of market power.\"\n",
      "The two shippers said they made a business decision to propose the \"index-to-index\" formula that produced the higher rates, rather than take the recourse rate \"to minimize any risk on transportation options.\"\n",
      "The index-to-index formula refers to taking the difference between the daily published commodity prices at two different points and subtracting to get the transportation rate between them.\n",
      "In this case the two points were the San Juan Basin and the SoCal Needles delivery point.\n",
      "The case was set for expedited hearing last summer by the commissioners acting on staff recommendations.\n",

      "NGI's Daily Gas Price Index  published : November 13, 2001 Watson: Enron Upside 'Clearly Worth Doing the Deal'  Dynegy CEO Chuck Watson told the investment community Monday that he was \"90% sure\" that the risk/reward ratio in the planned merger with Enron Corp. made it \"clearly worth doing the deal,\" because the issues that decimated the former market leader were with its non-core businesses.\n",
      "Explaining that his team had \"adequately bracketed the downside,\" as the deal fell together over the past few weeks, Watson said he could not be \"99% positive,\" but noted that the upside was \"substantial,\" and said he had a \"good deal of confidence...that we'll be absolutely fine here.\"\n",
      "Dynegy, which announced a $22 billion cash, stock and debt deal with its downtown Houston rival on Friday night, joined with Enron executives including Chairman Kenneth Lay on Monday to answer as many questions as they could in about 90 minutes.\n",
      "If all goes to plan, the two companies would become Dynegy Inc. by the third quarter of 2002, the clear leader in natural gas and power marketing.\n",
      "In the second quarter 2001, Enron and Dynegy combined sold a total of 36.2 Bcf/d of gas, which represented 21% of the volumes sold by the top 20 gas marketers in North America (168.9 Bcf/d), according to a ranking by NGI.\n",
      "Enron was the top gas marketer with 25.3 Bcf/d and Dynegy was No.\n",
      "6 with 10.9 Bcf/d.\n",
      "Statistics provided by Maryland-based Energy Performance Review (EPR) show that Enron and Dynegy combined sold 143,824 million kWh of power in the second quarter.\n",
      "That total represented 14% of the power sold by the top 20 largest power marketers (1,000,961 million kWh), according to EPR.\n",
      "Enron was in fifth place among power marketers with 73,724 million kWh sold, while Dynegy was in sixth place with 70,100 million kWh.\n",
      "The blending of the two will not come without challenges, but Watson stressed he expects to see more opportunities than problems.\n",
      "The opportunity appears to have come none too soon for Enron.\n",
      "Greg Whalley, Enron's president and a future member of Dynegy's executive team, confirmed that without some kind of equity investment in the company, the once market leader probably could not have sustained its liquidity through the rest of this year.\n",
      "\"We definitely needed to raise some type of equity capital,\" said Whalley.\n",
      "\"Under normal market conditions, we would have had adequate liquidity.\n",
      "This was not normal for Enron.\n",
      "We would not have had liquidity to the end of the year.\"\n",
      "Asked about asset sales in anticipation of meeting federal requirements to merge, executives acknowledged there would be some, but did not elaborate.\n",
      "Whalley said that from an \"Enron perspective, we have not spent a lot of time with Dynegy people to agree on a plan.\n",
      "Chuck (Watson) has to clear what is core to Dynegy.\n",
      "There are several (assets for consideration to sell) on the list.\"\n",
      "Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, who will not be part of the management team, but may hold a place on the Dynegy board of directors, added that Enron already has $4 billion in sales under contract, all expected to close by the end of 2002.\n",
      "\"We also have three other significant international assets under contract,\" said Lay, referring to the among other things, the Dabhol power plant in India.\n",
      "Once the merger of Dynegy with Enron is successfully completed, the new Dynegy will become the \"primary market player in all markets,\" but there will be a significant difference in how the company moves forward, noted Dynegy CFO Rob Doty.\n",
      "Enron's financial-backed trading strategy will merge with the \"strong asset base\" of Dynegy's.\n",
      "Dynegy has protected itself on the downside, however.\n",
      "The deal includes an out for Dynegy if Enron's legal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion.\n",
      "Asked about the possibility that some of Enron's marketing and trading team may desert the company for another company, Watson, stressing that teamwork will be the guiding force going forward, said, \"if I were in this industry, this is the combination I'd work for.\n",
      "This is an exciting day here.\n",
      "It's been an exciting couple of weeks\" creating a \"platform for something really special in the future.\"\n",
      "Enron's Whalley said that he believes the company will keep most of its team intact.\n",
      "\"They're accustomed to being part of a winning deal,\" he said, and \"going forward, they will be very pleased with the additional infusion of equity and the stability in the marketplace.\"\n",
      "As of Monday morning, Whalley said that \"activity looks pretty good,\" and said there had been a positive reception to the merger.\n",
      "\"Right now, people are pleased with the introduction of new liquidity, and really want to go about establishing or re-establishing the energy franchise.\"\n",
      "Dynegy President Steve Bergstrom agreed.\n",
      "\"Most traders want to be part of a winning team.\n",
      "This is a combination that will be a winning team.\n",
      "We have similar issues there as well.\n",
      "The 'A' players will stay around to be part of the winning team.\"\n",
      "Bergstrom explained that when the merger is complete, the new Dynegy will become the \"primary player in all markets.\"\n",
      "He said Dynegy has a \"more asset-backed strategy,\" adding that he has said before that \"you can only have one market maker and Enron clearly was it.\"\n",
      "By combining the two companies, there will be a blend of Dynegy's asset strategy with Enron's \"financial skill set,\" giving the new entity \"more liquidity market-making than Dynegy itself has historically done.\"\n",
      "Added Watson, \"both companies had a successful ratio and nothing is going to change there...I'm a strong believer in teams and the team concept.\n",
      "I don't want to see individuals do well if the company doesn't do well.\n",
      "It (will be) imbedded in the whole company.\"\n",
      "Ben Schlesinger, whose company Schlesinger & Associates analyzes the energy industry, said Monday that the big problem in the merger is \"whether these two companies are able to pull together...to harness what's there.\"\n",
      "He said the \"two parties are clearly leaders,\" but theoretically, they will have to streamline their operations.\n",
      "\"Both books are fairly strong,\" he said, and once their efficiencies are put together, the new company will offer \"stable returns.\"\n",
      "In the \"very short term,\" however, Schlesinger said there will be moves to other traders.\n",
      "Other analysts also seemed to be throwing support behind the merger.\n",
      "UBS Warburg reiterated its \"strong buy\" rating on Dynegy, noting that \"if successfully executed, this transaction would yield the most widely recognized, respected and downright credible wholesale/retail energy merchant in the world.\"\n",
      "However, UBS warned that Dynegy still faces a \"daunting\" task in merging the operations and employees.\n",
      "\"We are not naive in underestimating the enormous challenge at hand.\n",
      "In the near-term, Enron must remain highly liquid, investment grade and its employees must remain focused on keeping its core wholesale/retail franchises up and running.\"\n",
      "Merrill Lynch's Donato Eassey reiterated the \"buy\" on Dynegy and \"moving to no opinion\" on Enron.\n",
      "He said, \"Dynegy has all the necessary skill sets and as importantly, the financial stability, resources and investor confidence and experience to get the job done...Enron's unparalleled online trading business should translate to significant prospects for the new Dynegy.\"\n",
      "Curt Launer, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, added that despite the size of the new company, \"we do not expect major divestitures or closing issues because of the lack of asset concentration and the inherent competitiveness of the natural gas and power marketing business.\"\n",
      "He noted too that with the combination, \"we have modeled a merchant unit that does 25% less business,\" because of \"cross trading between them and some expectation of a loss of market share.\"\n",
      "Still, Launer said Dynegy would become a \"formidable competitor\" benefiting from a market share in excess of 20% of U.S. natural gas and power trading markets.\"\n",
      "As expected with most major merger announcements, Moody's Investors Service placed the ratings of Dynegy and its subsidiaries under review for possible downgrade, noting that \"notwithstanding the franchise benefits of the proposed merger, the financial and business risks associated with the transaction could negatively impact Dynegy's credit fundamentals.\"\n",
      "The review affects about $4 billion of Dynegy securities, including its subsidiaries Illinova Corp. and Illinois Power Co.\n",
      "In its rating review, Moody's said it will \"assess Dynegy's plans to meet the liquidity needs of the combined entity and to deal with the uncertainty surrounding Enron's off-balance sheet transactions and contingent risks...and examine the ultimate structure of the transaction, and its impact on Dynegy's financial leverage and on management's targeted debt levels.\"\n",
      "The ratings service also plans to \"consider the governance framework within which the combined trading activities will operate.\"\n",
      "Ratings under review are: Dynegy's Prime-3 rating for commercial paper; Dynegy Holdings' Baa2 senior unsecured debt rating and its Prime-2 rating for commercial paper; Illinova Corp.'s Baa3 senior unsecured debt rating; and Illinois Power Co.'s Baa1 senior secured and Baa2 senior unsecured debt ratings, and its Prime-2 rating for commercial paper.\n",
      "Fitch revised its rating watch on Enron's outstanding securities to \"evolving\" from \"negative,\" where they were placed in late October.\n",
      "The rating watch evolving means the ratings may be raised, lowered or maintained.\n",
      "Fitch also placed a rating watch negative on Dynegy and Dynegy Holding's long-term credit ratings, which also means they could be lowered or affirmed.\n",
      "The outstanding \"F2\" rated commercial paper programs for Dynegy and Dynegy Holdings were not affected.\n",

      "About Coppelia Copp?lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th?atre Imp?rial de L'Op?ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L?on and music by L?o Delibes.\n",
      "The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the turn of the century.\n",
      "Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as follows: \"Copp?lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score.\n",
      "But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's prologue.\"\n",
      "Copp?lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp?lius), and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer.\n",
      "In November 1979, former Royal Ballet ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company.\n",
      "When Houston Ballet premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking d?cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, \"It would be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking new production of Copp?lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater stage.\"\n",
      "(The Houston Post, March 21, 1992) Heeley's designs for Copp?lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the second-act depiction of Dr. Copp?lius's workshop.\n",
      "The sampling of dolls on display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity.\n",
      "Among the eye-popping toys featured in \tthe workshop are a huge astrologer with a pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the back of a goat.\n",
      "In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.\n",

      "February 4, 2002 Enron boss cancels testimony  Cites 'disturbing' TV talk: Blames 'prosecutorial' tone, claims of security fraud Jason Chow  National Post  Former Enron Corp. chairman Kenneth Lay said yesterday he would not testify at today's scheduled congressional hearing into the company's collapse, blaming legislators' \"prosecutorial\" comments on TV talk shows yesterday.\n",
      "\"Not only were there corrupt practices, we are finding what may clearly end up being security fraud,\" Republican Rep. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, told NBC's Meet the Press.\n",
      "An internal company report released Saturday criticized Mr. Lay, other executives, board members and auditors for the collapse.\n",
      "It showed managers took home millions of dollars through complex partnerships, while hiding at least US$1-billion in losses.\n",
      "Other politicians denounced the company's management before TV cameras yesterday in response to the report.\n",
      "Last night, Mr. Lay cancelled his testimony.\n",
      "\"In the midst of our preparation, particularly disturbing statements have been made by members of Congress, even today, on the eve of Mr. Lay's scheduled appearance,\" his lawyer, Earl Silbert, said in a letter to lawmakers on the Senate Commerce Committee and the House Financial Services Committee.\n",
      "\"I have instructed Mr. Lay to withdraw his prior acceptance of your invitation.\"\n",
      "Sen. Byron Dorgan, chairman of another Senate Commerce subcommittee investigating the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history, said on Meet the Press the report \"suggests massive problems\" and shows \"a culture of corruption.\"\n",
      "While Mr. Dorgan said it was up to the U.S. Justice Department to decide whether to press criminal charges, he added the report showed \"clearly some things have happened here that are going to put some people here in real jeopardy.\"\n",
      "The 203-page report, written by a team headed by the dean of the University of Texas Law School, said Mr. Lay \"bears significant responsibility\" for \"flawed decisions\" in approving some transactions that hid debt and offset losses.\n",
      "The report said these transactions did not follow accounting rules and were implemented improperly, resulting in Enron overstating earnings by US$1-billion during a one-year period starting in September, 2000.\n",

      "Each seminar in the series discussed the benefits of PROS commercial optimization systems in the natural gas industry.\n",
      "Each seminar included case studies which provided participants an insight to the practical applications of PROS science-based optimization systems.\n",
      "Focused on pipelines, storage, and trading, these seminars enabled participants from various areas of the energy industry to take advantage of pricing and revenue optimization best practices.\n",
      "\"These seminars were a resounding success,\" says Matt Johnson, PROS' Senior VP of Energy.\n",
      "\"PROS is continuing to take the leadership role for transfer of our mature revenue management science and technology into the energy industry.\n",
      "Based on the positive feedback of key energy first-movers, we anticipate several more of these innovative, interactive seminars in 2002.\n",
      "These sessions allowed attendees to have access to free, informative business case studies reflecting state-of-the-art energy revenue management.\"\n",
      "The PROS Trading Optimization System can increase gas trading profitability by 10-15% by generating the optimal routing of supply to market given all pipeline contract constraints, gas purchase and sale obligations, and trading opportunities.\n",
      "The system recommends optimal spot gas buy/sell strategies and provides real-time physical position and opportunity cost data between any two points on the pipeline network.\n",
      "The result is the reduction of the gas scheduling process to less than 60 seconds.\n",
      "The PROS Storage Revenue Management System has been shown to increase revenues from the sale of storage capacity by 7-25% after initial implementations.\n",
      "This system provides pipelines, storage marketers and traders with the ability to maximize revenue from the sale of storage services and contracts.\n",
      "It provides the comprehensive ability to analyze the value of storage using PROS' state-of-the-art revenue management science and to execute and track those deals in real-time.\n",
      "The PROS Transportation Revenue Management System has demonstrated a revenue lift of 7-15% for firm transportation services in both open-season and negotiated sales environments.\n",
      "It allows natural gas pipelines to maximize revenue from the sale of transportation capacity.\n",
      "The system uses PROS' mature forecasting technology to predict demand for transportation contracts and forecast the customer utilization of existing contracts.\n",
