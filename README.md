# Tagging data via characteristics and structures

This repository is created for Capstone project DAEN 690. Team Name - Out of Datum. Our project scope is around extracting meta data via characteristics and structures.

## Abstract

The extensive use of personally identifiable information (PII), which has caused widespread concern, has accelerated the development of information and technology. Being able to identify PII is now more crucial than ever with the implementation of GDPR and CCPA, as well as the trend of individuals being more aware of how their personal information is being used and privacy concerns growing in several sectors. Businesses keep a lot of data and information on hand, both sensitive and non-sensitive. Therefore, we utilize regular expression to uncover patterns in order to determine which data includes Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Only in this way can PII be tagged to comprehend which is PII and non-PII. We take into account privacy factors before determining if the data contains PII and categorize the findings as sensitive or non-sensitive. We are focused on automatizing tagging for PII, or personally identifying information. We gathered structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data for analysis, as well as visualization and natural language processing (NLP) algorithm analysis to combine the regular expression and spaCy, Steam to detect PII. After scanning and carefully examining the data, and using privacy rules as a guide, our process will provide findings.
